<lb id="L05L009" n="009"/>waited to give me good news. I am 
<lb id="L05L010" n="010"/>deeply grieved, and notwithstanding 
<lb id="L05L011" n="011"/>your precaution in preparing the
<lb id="L05L012" n="012"/>way to tell me finally that he was
<lb id="L05L013" n="013"/>&quot;still forever.&quot; I was smitten to the
<lb id="L05L014" n="014"/>heart when I came to that; for I 
<lb id="L05L015" n="015"/>began to think you told me the details 
<lb id="L05L016" n="016"/>of his illness as the &quot;sad news&quot; and that 
<lb id="L05L017" n="017"/>he lived yet here below. Fortunately
<lb id="L05L018" n="018"/>the blow made me burst into tears 
<lb id="L05L019" n="019"/>and sobs, (a very rare thing for me now)
<lb id="L05L020" n="020"/>so that the acute pang did not hurt me
<lb id="L05L021" n="021"/>so much. But I am in the greatest
<lb id="L05L022" n="022"/>anxiety about <name key="" reg="Mann, Mary Tyler  Peabody, 1806-1887" type="person">Mary</name>. The
                    world has 
<lb id="L05L023" n="023"/>lost a rare person. Where will you find 
<lb id="L05L024" n="024"/>such fidelity, such devotion, such earnestness, 
<lb id="L05L025" n="025"/>such perseverance, such solemn 
<lb id="L05L026" n="026"/>dedication of the talents God has given.
<lb id="L05L027" n="027"/>I loved him greatly, and my respect 
<lb id="L05L028" n="028"/>for his life was profound. I mourn
<lb id="L05L029" n="029"/>for my dear <name key="" reg="Mann, Horace, Jr. ??" type="person">Horace</name> with deepest 
<lb id="L05L030" n="030"/>sorrow. I did hope to persuade him 
<lb id="L05L031" n="031"/>to come to us in Dresden for recreation, 
<lb id="L05L032" n="032"/>change and observation of the gains 
<lb id="L05L033" n="033"/>of science here. He was so large in
<lb id="L05L034" n="034"/>his scope. When I asked him once
<lb id="L05L035" n="035"/>which branch of science he <hi rend="underscore">preferred</hi>

<lb id="L05L036" n="036"/>he looked at me with surprise and replied
<lb id="L05L037" n="037"/>&quot;How can I like one branch of science better
<lb id="L05L038" n="038"/>than another?&quot; True enough &mdash; how can 
<lb id="L05L039" n="039"/>anyone &mdash; and yet, how few have this 
<lb id="L05L040" n="040"/>broad love, and how many keep in 
<lb id="L05L041" n="041"/>one groove. His was indeed the genuine 
<lb id="L05L042" n="042"/>love for the widest knowledge. His 
<lb id="L05L043" n="043"/>magnificent purposes and hopes 
<lb id="L05L044" n="044"/>probably needed another sphere to 
<lb id="L05L045" n="045"/>be fulfilled, for oh <name key="" reg="Peabody, Elisabeth Palmer, 1804-1894" type="person">Elisabeth</name>, I
    <hi rend="underscore">never</hi>
<lb id="L05L046" n="046"/>believed that <name key="" reg="Mann, Horace, Jr. ??" type="person">Horace</name> would live to

<lb id="L05L048" n="048"/><hi rend="underscore">I was sure</hi> he would die young, and 
<lb id="L05L049" n="049"/>so I am not surprised, however much 
<lb id="L05L050" n="050"/>I grieve. He had not robustness of 
<lb id="L05L051" n="051"/>constitution enough to bear such <unclear reason="obscured by ink stain" rend="">constant</unclear>
<lb id="L05L052" n="052"/> and profound study. He told me once 
<lb id="L05L053" n="053"/> he was never for one moment rested,
<lb id="L05L054" n="054"/> and never expected to be! He worked 
<lb id="L05L055" n="055"/> with pure spirit always, and not 
<lb id="L05L056" n="056"/> with physical power. Even his 
<lb id="L05L057" n="057"/> enormous walks and climbings 
<lb id="L05L058" n="058"/> and reachings in America and 
<lb id="L05L059" n="059"/> the Sandwich Islands <seg>
                  <note target="n4">4</note>
               </seg> and everywhere, 
<lb id="L05L060" n="060"/> were accomplished because his 
<lb id="L05L061" n="061"/> will and wish were so omnipotent&mdash;
<lb id="L05L062" n="062"/> not because he had bodily force 
<lb id="L05L063" n="063"/> enough. It was sublime and 
<lb id="L05L064" n="064"/> beautiful to a degree<del hand="SPH" type="overstrike">hardly</del>
<lb id="L05L065" n="065"/> surpassed. I feel honored that I 
<lb id="L05L066" n="066"/> was related to him. I think there
<lb id="L05L067" n="067"/> never was a purer sacrifice offered 
<lb id="L05L068" n="068"/> to disinterested science. He was a 
<lb id="L05L069" n="069"/> martyr without stain. When I saw

<lb id="L05L071" n="071"/> brow (as I <hi rend="underscore">know</hi>) it was astonishing to 
<lb id="L05L072" n="072"/> observe the fine beauty of his face&mdash;
<lb id="L05L073" n="073"/> the intellectual dignity suddenly
<lb id="L05L074" n="074"/>increased so much. Julian<seg>
                  <note target="n5">5</note>
               </seg> remarked 
<lb id="L05L075" n="075"/>yesterday that when he bade him 
<lb id="L05L076" n="076"/>goodbye on the eve before we left Boston 
<lb id="L05L077" n="077"/>that he had never seen him look 
<lb id="L05L078" n="078"/>so well&mdash;(meaning so fine in expression) 
<lb id="L05L079" n="079"/>Ah it is we only who are disappointed! 
<lb id="L05L080" n="080"/>and lamenting&mdash; For just think of him 
<lb id="L05L081" n="081"/>now with no obstruction between him 
<lb id="L05L082" n="082"/>and the universe of God. Think how 
<lb id="L05L083" n="083"/>his face shines with eternal joy as 
<lb id="L05L084" n="084"/>he apprehends the secrets of creation. 
<lb id="L05L085" n="085"/>If he had had a stronger body and 
<lb id="L05L086" n="086"/>tougher health, he would doubtless 
<lb id="L05L087" n="087"/>have lost in delicacy of perception 
<lb id="L05L088" n="088"/>and acute sensibility to all the
<lb id="L05L089" n="089"/>mysterious laws and results of Nature. 
<lb id="L05L090" n="090"/>Also in living here among less

<lb id="L05L094" n="094"/>He was too susceptible of suffering for 
<lb id="L05L095" n="095"/>those who loved him vitally, to really 
<lb id="L05L096" n="096"/>enjoy his progress. I was always in
<lb id="L05L097" n="097"/>terror of the sudden breaking down 
<lb id="L05L098" n="098"/>of overtaxed brain and nerves.
<lb id="L05L099" n="099"/>I thank God he did not lose his 
<lb id="L05L100" n="100"/>reason under the pressure of his cares. 
<lb id="L05L101" n="101"/>Oh how much better that he should 
<lb id="L05L102" n="102"/>enter into endless Rest than to 
<lb id="L05L103" n="103"/>merely exist<add hand="SPH" place="supralinear"> here </add> without use of reason. 
<lb id="L05L104" n="104"/>That would surely have broken our hearts.

<lb id="L05L196" n="196"/> of purpose and varied knowledge

<lb id="L05L198" n="198"/> so attractive to Mr. Hawthorne &mdash;; 
<lb id="L05L199" n="199"/> and in his presence there was such 
<lb id="L05L200" n="200"/> a modest dignity of manners &mdash;; 
<lb id="L05L201" n="201"/> so thoughtful an air of 
<lb id="L05L202" n="202"/> conscientious consideration as 
<lb id="L05L203" n="203"/> was truly beautiful.

<lb id="L05L207" n="207"/> presented me with a radiant

<lb id="L05L209" n="209"/> to see him come &mdash;; but how seldom 
<lb id="L05L210" n="210"/> he came. I felt he could not waste

<lb id="L05L212" n="212"/> impressed me with the value of 
<lb id="L05L213" n="213"/> moments. He never wasted any
<lb id="L05L214" n="214"/> time! What a marvel! Not since 
<lb id="L05L215" n="215"/> childhood, when he began to try 
<lb id="L05L216" n="216"/> chemic experiments. How thoroughly
