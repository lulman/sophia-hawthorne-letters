            1837</a><br><p style="font-size:.85em;">
            
            In this letter, Sophia Peabody attempts to correct misunderstandings between herself
            and her sister 
            Elizabeth regarding Sophia's estimation of Abigail May Alcott [Mrs. Bronson Alcott]
            and, more generally, 
            the sisters' differing attitudes toward "fault-finding." Before mailing the letter
            to Elizabeth, Sophia gives it 
            to her sister Mary, who adds her own perspective on the misunderstanding, asking for
            sympathy

            <br>0001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            8th August
            <br>0002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            My Dear Elizabeth,
            
            
            <br>0003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I have just read your long letter. 
            <br>0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I cannot wait a moment before disabusing you 
            <br>0005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of one entire<span class="cancel">ly</span> mistake, which is your
            impres‐
            <br>0006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            sion of my estimation of Mrs. Alcott. You <U>never</U>
            <br>0007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             heard me express for her a want of respect or
            <br>0008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             love; for from the beginning &amp; through all 
            <br>0009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I have thought her a sort of sublime phe‐<br>0010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            nomenon — a terrible power made up of 
            <br>0011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            divinest tenderness— vast humanity — infinite
            <br>0012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             self sacrifice — a perfect juggernaut devotion 
            <br>0013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             to the Right. I have loved her dearly always.
            <br>0014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             How can you think otherwise. Don't you remember 
            <br>0015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             at th[e]at time my sympathy with her — &amp; afterwards 
            <br>0016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             my writing often to her, &amp; ever since the affectionate 
            <br>0017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             way in which we have ever met. I have always 
            <br>0018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             felt the utmost tenderness for her. I scarcely 
            <br>0019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             ever saw a person who seemed to me so full 
            <br>0020&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of pathos — amounting to the fearful. I am at a
            <br>0021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             loss to imagine how you have such an idea in 
            <br>0022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             your mind. Does it not show what complete,
            <br>0023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             misunderstandings may exist — ↑  I <U>never</U> thought her deformed,  ↓  never moved by earthly passion.
            
            <br>0024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I had a long talk with Mary the other 
            <br>0025&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             evening about this discussing of people's faults. 
            <br>0026&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             She said she never before understood what
            <br>0027&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I meant, &amp; she did not believe you did.
            <br>0028&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             It is not that I do not see people do wrong — &amp; that 
            <br>0029&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             therefore I necessarily am unjust — but I have 
            <br>0030&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             understood Christ to teach that if each one looked 
            <br>0031&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             only to his own errors,  ↑  [perhaps?]  ↓  there would be juster [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
            
            <br>0032&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             judgment &amp; greater improvement in individuals. 
            <br>0033&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             When he speaks plainly I prefer to understand 
            <br>0034&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             him plainly, for I find it the most fruitful 
            <br>0035&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of good. It has not been a personal feeling 
            <br>0036&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             for particular persons — for Mr. Alcott for instance, 
            <br>0037&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             but this general principle, which would make
            <br>0038&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             me feel the same if a person I never knew
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Section&nbsp;-&nbsp;2

            <br>0039&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             were analysed &amp; decided upon. I know 
            <br>0040&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             that GOD only can know a person truly, 
            <br>0041&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             from my own experience, &amp; I know that immense 
            <br>0042&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             mistakes are made in sweeping or even in what
            <br>0043&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             seem cool, rational judgments of others. 
            <br>0044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             But as the seeing mind cannot but observe 
            <br>0045&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I have thought that each person had better 
            <br>0046&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             not  ↑ by talking
             ↓  emphasize bad opinions of men —[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]  arguing 
            <br>0047&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             pronouncing &amp; deciding upon their motives &amp; actions, 
            <br>0048&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             which ever must be somewhat in the dark —
            <br>0049&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             but let the opinion be constantly modified
            <br>0050&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             or changed  ↑ in the mind ↓  by the evolving of circumstances &amp; 
            <br>0051&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             the influx of more light. Then no one would 
            <br>0052&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             be so cruelly wronged as some are — &amp; there 
            <br>0053&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             would be more time &amp; room for the interchange 
            <br>0054&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of thought about things which are eternal —
            <br>0055&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Christ might say <q>Woe unto you, hypocrites!</q> because 
            <br>0056&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             there was no mote in his eye to take out,<a id="pmote" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nmote" class="annotation" title="See Matt. 7: 3-5."><sup>1</sup></a> &amp; he 
            <br>0057&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <br>0058&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             man, but it is not so with the less exalted. 
            <br>0059&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I have said to myself Oh let me enjoy &amp; speak 
            <br>0060&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of the good I see — &amp; be silent of the evil I see. 
            <br>0061&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            You <span class="cancel">have</span> &amp; Mary have thought me morbid about 
            <br>0062&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             hearing certain people spoken of — I always knew
            <br>0063&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             this was not the truth. It was not the person 
            <br>0064&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             but the thing that I struggled against. 
            <br>0065&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Even when I have mutely listened, I have 
            <br>0066&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             always had a mental reservation that perhaps 
            <br>0067&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             it was not so — for GOD alone could see the heart —
            <br>0068&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             &amp; comprehend all the grounds upon which it 
            <br>0069&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             acted. I can see good in being openeyed
            <br>0070&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &amp; not acting with a rash confidence — but I
            <br>0071&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            percieve [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
             the least use in talking
            <br>0074&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            about them. I never hear of a great crime
            <br>0075&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            committed that I do not wish I had a hundred
            <br>0076&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <br>0080&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            transgressed—and it is an infinite comfort to me
            <br>0081&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            always to know that GOD knows all &amp; will accordingly

            community never seems to me so dreadful or wrong
            <br>0085&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            in the eye of Heaven as the animadversions of
            <br>0086&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <br>0088&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            that to you it may seem quite otherwise about
            <br>0089&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            this matter, &amp; that you do your duty in a way
            <br>0090&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            of proceeding, which with my idea—it would
            <br>0091&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            manifestly be wrong for me to adopt.
            <br>0092&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I <U>never thought it want of charity</U> in you

            <br>0095&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            every body was better then I, <span style="font-style:italic">ceteris paribus.</span>
            <br>0117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Do not suppose I extend this to fault finding face 
            <br>0118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to face. I think this is good &amp; productive of great
            <br>0119&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            benefit — for then the two persons being all that 
            <br>0120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            are concerned in the matter can take care of
            <br>0121&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            themselves, &amp; be improved by each other's lights. 
            <br>0122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span class="cancel">It is bad</span> But to talk &amp; judge of a person

            <br>0125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            ever take for granted by inference a harsh judgment. Now both
            <br>0126&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            you &amp; Mary have taken up this idea of my view of Mrs. Alcott
            <br>0127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            because I had said she was violent &amp; said tremendous things to
            <br>0128&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            her husband. But you should have stopped at my words — &amp; then you

            would
            <br>0130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have been

            more just —
            <br>0132&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I never

            you know

            what I

            but Christ was ever beautiful — &amp; my aim is to do so, as well as true &amp;
            <br>0162&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            good — for I think Beauty is the result of the two. But I never was

            <br>0163&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             aware of seeking beauty in the first place. By keeping my heart
            <br>0164&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             right, which [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
             is goodness, I hope to see truth, &amp; then Beauty
            <br>0165&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             will flow. This is my order — not the contrary. I have scarcely
            <br>0166&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             taken the first step; but I feel that this is
            <br>0167&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             the way to go.

             She wrote it with difficulty
            <br>0183&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             for she had a raging headache

              &amp; has been on the bed &amp; dizzy.
            <br>0185&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             When she finished yr letter she 
            <br>0186&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            burst into tears. I told her I 
            <br>0187&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             hoped that would give her
            <br>0188&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             pleasure — she said it did,
            <br>0189&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             but she could not help crying —

             &amp; that you did not understand

            <br>0195&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             but I did not persist in
            <br>0196&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             talking, for she said she felt
            <br>0197&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             as if her body was just where 
            <br>0198&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

             alluded to again. I hope you will not
            <br>0208&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             say Alcott for one year if you can help
            <br>0209&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             it, for the word is the touchstone to
            <br>0210&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             all this emotion. There is no temper

             that it will be perhaps difficult to appear

            My dearLizzie,
            
            
            <br>0003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I suppose that Mr Taylor
            has
            <br>0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            told you of George's perfect frame
            <br>0005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            of mind — of his experience of
            <br>0006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            that divine glow which was so
            <br>0007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            unaccountable — but so sweet &amp;
            <br>0008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            refreshing to him — &amp; seemed so like
            <br>0009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            an intimation from GOD that
            <br>0010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            it was well with him —; but he
            <br>0011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            would not tell you how like
            <br>0012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            a tender &amp; strong angel he  ↓  ^ ↑ 
             ↑  himself  ↓  was
            <br>0013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to us all — what a wonderful
            <br>0014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            prayer he offered — which seemed
            <br>0015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to bring the host of heaven
            <br>0016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            down to watch &amp; duly ward -
            <br>0017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            which brought heaven into
            <br>0018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            George's chamber &amp; carried us

            all as on Dove's wings into

            the spiritual world.  It was the

            most fervid — the most affectionate,
            <br>0022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            tender &amp; divine uplifting of 
            <br>0023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            soul to the infinite Father —
            <br>0024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            that I ever heard.  He prayed for 
            <br>0025&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            each — for the <q>Mother, the tender
               <br>0026&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               Mother — who hung around her life</q>
            <br>0027&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            for the Father's manly heart —
            <br>0028&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            for the sister whose duty called
            <br>0029&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            her away — <q> &amp; oh —  bless <U>our dear Mary</U></q>
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;2

            <br>0030&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            he said — <q>let not that peaceful
               <br>0031&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               stream be disturbed — </q> he prayed
            <br>0032&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            for the sister present — 'she with
            <br>0033&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            the delicate nerves —' For Aunt
            <br>0034&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Pickman too he petitioned
            <br>0035&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Heaven —     The tears were at
            <br>0036&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            last loosened from my brain
            <br>0037&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            which I had kept back so long
            <br>0038&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            that I began to feel as if they
            <br>0039&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            were accumulating there —
            <br>0040&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &amp; they flowed down my face
            <br>0041&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            like a summer rain without
            <br>0042&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            convulsion.  After he rose
            <br>0043&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            from his knees, George stretched 
            <br>0044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            out his arms &amp; Mr Taylor
            <br>0045&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            clasped him to his heart in
            <br>0046&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            a long, long embrace — Every
            <br>0047&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            moment ejaculating "The Lord
            <br>0048&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            bless you!  Bless you!  Bless you!"
            <br>0049&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            in such a thrilling tone that
            <br>0050&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            it seemed as if blessings must
            <br>0051&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            come in legions at the call —
            <br>0052&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            George's thin white hands were
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;3
               &nbsp;(<a href="Letter2_P3.jpg" target="_blank">click to open page image in a new window</a>)]</span>
            
            <br>0053&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            so firmly fastened round his neck
            <br>0054&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            that I thought he would never
            <br>0055&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            let the Angel go — even after he
            <br>0056&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            had blessed him — but at last
            <br>0057&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            he relaxed his hold. Then  Mr
            <br>0058&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Taylor turned to me &amp; took both
            <br>0059&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            hands. <q>Be strong</q> said he. <q>
               <U>It is</U>
               <br>0060&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               <U>very pleasant on the other side</U>—Be
               <br>0061&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               quiet alike a May morning.</q>
            <br>0062&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            He came with me into my room.
            <br>0063&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            <q>Oh George is a perfect lamb! A
               <br>0064&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               perfect lamb. He is moonlight —
               <br>0065&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               so clear — mild — I would not but
               <br>0066&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               have seen him for the world. It
               <br>0067&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               was worth coming just to look at
               <br>0068&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               him. He never looked so handsome
               <br>0069&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               in his life. There is no distortion
               <br>0070&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               there. All is right. All is right.</q>
            <br>0071&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I cannot tell you all he said now.
            <br>0072&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Oh he is the most helpful — the
            <br>0073&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            divinest spirit — is he not?
            <br>0074&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            George said there could not be such
            <br>0075&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            a prayer conceived of. <q>Mr. Taylor
               <br>0076&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               is no sham</q> — he said.
            <br>0077&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            George is very much revived this
            <br>0078&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            afternoon. He had not a bad
            <br>0079&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            chill this morning — hardly any — &amp;
            <br>0080&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            yesterday it was
            <br>0081&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            two hours long 
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;4
               &nbsp;(<a href="Letter2_P4.jpg" target="_blank">click to open page image in a new window</a>)]</span>
            
            <br>0082&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            Mary came today &amp; staid two hours
            <br>0083&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I carried her your letter this afternoon
            <br>0084&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &amp; she had recieved [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
             no harm.
            <br>0085&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            George thinks it would not be
            <br>0086&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            right for you to come on
            <br>0087&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Wednesday. He thinks of
            <br>0088&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            every thing in all relations
            <br>0089&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            with exactest precision.
            <br>0090&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Yesterday he wandered a
            <br>0091&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            little several times, &amp; this
            <br>0092&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            afternoon while I was rubbing
            <br>0093&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            his arm, he was saying
            <br>0094&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            something — &amp; then said something
            <br>0095&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I did not hear. <q>What did
               <br>0096&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               you say</q> I asked. <q>It believe
               <br>0097&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               was nothing to the purpose, he
               <br>0098&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               replied. <U>I was wandering</U>.</q>
            <br>0099&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I never saw such clearness. He
            <br>0100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            looks from some high place
            <br>0101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            even upon his aberrations.
            <br>0102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I can write no more now
            <br>0103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I recieved [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
             a blessed refreshment
            <br>0104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            yesterday P.M. beside  Mr
            <br>0105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Taylor, a long — closely written letter

            <br>0003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            My dear Elizabeth,
             I am really
            
            <br>0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            too tired to write a letter,
            <br>0005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            but cannot bear to let a
            <br>0006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            chance slip. Una has
            
            <br>0007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            written a sad letter which
            <br>0008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I fear will make your
            <br>0009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            heart ache. I am glad
            <br>0010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to say that the Roman
            <br>0011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            fever seems to have been
            <br>0012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            arrested in her — for she
            <br>0013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            has had no chills for two
            <br>0014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            days. She is a lily now,
            <br>0015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            her lifelong roses snatched
            <br>0016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            away, but during these
            <br>0017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            two days I have thought
            <br>0018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to see a dawn of roses
            <br>0019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            in her cheeks and lips,
            <br>0020&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            though she is now suffering
            <br>0021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            from influenza.
            
            
            
            
            <br>0022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Ada's fever is past. She
            <br>0023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            is well of that today, but has
            <br>0024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            a very painful shoulder —
            <br>0025&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and lies in bed still.

            <br>0026&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I have had no moment to 
            <br>0027&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             write to you in all these 
            <br>0028&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             weeks — having been ill 
            <br>0029&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             myself in the interval 
            <br>0030&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of nursing others.  No Rome 
            <br>0031&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             this winter for us so far. 
            <br>0032&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             My journal is left in the 
            <br>0033&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             middle of a sentence, which 
            <br>0034&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             can never be recalled 
            <br>0035&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             now, <span class="cancel">though</span> and I am 
            <br>0036&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             sorry, because I had an 
            <br>0037&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             idea of the Faun at that
            <br>0038&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            moment. 
            
            
            
            <br>0039&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Perhaps we shall have 
            <br>0040&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             February and March 
            <br>0041&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             for a little enjoyment 
            <br>0042&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of Rome, and half of April. 
            <br>0043&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Then we leave it for aye 
            <br>0044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and go to Venice and thence 
            <br>0045&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             to the cities in the north 
            <br>0046&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of Italy &amp; to Geneva and 
            <br>0047&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Paris. 
            
            
            
            <br>0048&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Mrs. Ward is here and I 
            <br>0049&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             have not had a moment 
            <br>0050&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             to go and see her.  But I had 
            <br>0051&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             a long note from her. She
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;3
               &nbsp;(<a href="Letter3_P3.jpg" target="_blank">click to open page image in a new window</a>)]</span>
            
            <br>0052&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             is very happy and content in her 
            <br>0053&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             sunny sky-parlor in the Hotel 
            <br>0054&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             d'Angliterre — <q>with no cares, no 
               <br>0055&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                anxieties, only hopes</q> she says. 
            <br>0056&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             She suffered terribly from the 
            <br>0057&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             severe treatment of Dr Simpson
            <br>0058&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             but expects to feel benefit 
            <br>0059&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             next summer from it. 
            <br>0060&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Neither have I been able to see 
            <br>0061&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             once Mrs Browning, and 
            <br>0062&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             only once Mr Browning who 
            <br>0063&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             has been three times to see 
            <br>0064&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             us.  Mrs Browning does not 
            <br>0065&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             make visits. Mary Motley
            <br>0066&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I see here sometimes.  I 
            <br>0067&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             have read the Dutch Republic<a id="pdutch" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#ndutch" class="annotation" title="Note about The Dutch Republic.."><sup>4</sup></a>
            <br>0068&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             during my watches, and the 
            <br>0069&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             book is superb, I think. 
            <br>0070&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Miss Cushman has been here, 
            <br>0071&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             but I could not see her. 
            <br>0072&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Mr. Hawthorne saw her. 
            <br>0073&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             No society for me this winter. 
            <br>0074&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Rosebud is exquisitely good 
            <br>0075&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             generous and considerate in 
            <br>0076&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             these times, but I can give 
            <br>0077&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             you no Altar of Roses now. 
            <br>0078&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Mr. Hawthorne is quite 
            <br>0079&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             well.  Here is cause for 
            <br>0080&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             great joy — for last winter he

             had the Grippe three months. 
            <br>0082&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Julian also is well with 
            <br>0083&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             only slight nose cold.

             Rose has today gone to

             the Palazzo Galitzin<a id="pgalitzin" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#ngalitzin" class="annotation" title="A fashionable district in the 19th century located in the center of Rome, just off the Tiber in Via della Scrofia #117 ROM 208-209."><sup>5</sup></a> to see 
            <br>0086&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            the Westons, who delight in 
            <br>0087&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             her.  She draws with a 
            <br>0088&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             wonderful expression.

             I long to answer all

             your letters one by one — 
            <br>0093&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and I long to tell you much. 
            <br>0094&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I have sent some letters 
            <br>0095&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of Una to you and Mary 
            <br>0096&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             lately.  I never got 
            <br>0097&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             yours and Mary's letters 
            <br>0098&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             directed to Florence.  Though 
            <br>0099&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Mr Browning has written 
            <br>0100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             about [?]them to the Post Office 
            <br>0101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             they do not come.  I have 
            <br>0102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             lost all your account of dear 
            <br>0103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Dr. Wesselhoeft. I endure 
            <br>0104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             astonishingly through all 
            <br>0105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             things.  Goodbye with

             thousand blessings.

            Sunday
            <br>0002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            My dear Elizabeth— I have
            
            
            <br>0003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             become so occupied with 
            <br>0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             the unhappy Weiss, that 
            <br>0005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             with my necessary household 
            <br>0006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             cares, mending &amp; making —
            <br>0007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I have not had one 
            <br>0008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             moment to answer your 
            <br>0009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             note. It is Sunday and 
            <br>0010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             all the children are at 
            <br>0011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Church, and I have a 
            <br>0012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             few moments of my own —
            <br>0013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and out of a hundred 
            <br>0014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             things I want to do, I 
            <br>0015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             take some  ↑ time ↓  for you. 
            <br>0016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             We could not take 
            <br>0017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             advantage of the free
            <br>0018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             lessons of Dr. Kinner
            <br>0019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             for Una, on account
            <br>0020&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             partly [and]of the expense 
            <br>0021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of railroad fare — while 
            <br>0022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             there were other reasons 
            <br>0023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            less imperative. I 
            <br>0024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            am very sorry, but
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;2

            <br>0025&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             since there is not 
            <br>0026&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             literally money enough 
            <br>0027&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             for it — I accept the 
            <br>0028&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             disappointment. For it 
            <br>0029&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             is certainly a very plain 
            <br>0030&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             duty not to spend other
            <br>0031&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             peoples' money for 
            <br>0032&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             accomplishments —  ↓ ^ ↑  ↑ or any thing else ↓ . And as 
            <br>0033&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             we are very closely pressed 
            <br>0034&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             this year — and feel it 
            <br>0035&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             important not to grind 
            <br>0036&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Julian too closely in
            <br>0037&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             college, (though he must 
            <br>0038&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             be exceedingly economical 
            <br>0039&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             at the best) — we must 
            <br>0040&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             all sacrifice a great 
            <br>0041&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             many pleasant things. 
            <br>0042&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             If Mr Hawthorne did 
            <br>0043&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             not write, we could by 
            <br>0044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             no means make our 
            <br>0045&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             expenses come within 
            <br>0046&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             our income, and 
            <br>0047&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             it is a pain to him
            <br>0048&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             to be so hard driven 
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;3
               &nbsp;(<a href="Letter4_P3.jpg" target="_blank">click to open page image in a new window</a>)]</span>
            
            <br>0049&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             in his present unenergetic 
            <br>0050&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             condition, and he 
            <br>0051&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             doubts if we can  ↑ at any rate ↓ 
            <br>0052&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             easily make the ends 
            <br>0053&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             meet. The Smiths have
            <br>0054&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             sent for Una and Julian
            <br>0055&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             to go to see them this 
            <br>0056&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             winter. But for the 
            <br>0057&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             same reason, they cannot 
            <br>0058&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             go. It would cost at 
            <br>0059&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             least thirty dollars for 
            <br>0060&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             travel from our door to theirs, and 
            <br>0061&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Julian would have to 
            <br>0062&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             have a new suit of 
            <br>0063&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             clothes — costing thirty
            <br>0064&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            more — before he could
            <br>0065&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            go. As to me, I am 
            <br>0066&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             going without any 
            <br>0067&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             thing new whatever 
            <br>0068&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and I only wish I could 
            <br>0069&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             give up any thing more	
            <br>0070&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             so as to gratify
            <br>0071&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             them. As to their father

            <br>0131&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

             in that long ago note

             I agreed with, however —
            <br>0134&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Rose's face expresses too
            <br>0135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             much critical displeasure
            <br>0136&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I very well see often.
            <br>0137&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             She is in precisely the

             mood that Una was

            <br>0141&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             disgusted with every body 
            <br>0142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and thing that did not

            <br>0144&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

             alarmed, until a certain 
            <br>0148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Mrs. Allbut told me
            <br>0149&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             that I need not fear
            <br>0150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             at all, for that when
            <br>0151&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Una was eighteen she
            <br>0152&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             would be all right, and
            <br>0153&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             that this fastidiousness
            <br>0154&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             at her age was the
            <br>0155&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             most hopeful of all
            <br>0156&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             states. I find it true.
            <br>0157&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Una is always excusing
            <br>0158&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             every body now, and 
            <br>0159&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             finding good points
            <br>0160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             in every one, and no
            <br>0161&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             soul is more full of
            <br>0162&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             generous, self sacrificing
            <br>0163&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             love. Every person I

             know in Concord
            <br>0165&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             bursts out to me about
            <br>0166&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             her in enthusiastic
            <br>0167&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             praise — not moderate 
            <br>0168&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             but enthusiastic praise.

             Miss Rose deserves your

             censure, but as she

             this is one thing they

             to make no show of

             you would not love 
            <br>0219&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             them little. And if 
            <br>0220&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             you could see how  Julian's

             innocence is becoming 
            <br>0222&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             virtue, you would be 
            <br>0223&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             glad as I am; and
            <br>0224&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             overflow sometimes. 
            <br>0225&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Religious principle is 
            <br>0226&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             the only sure guard
            <br>0227&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             angelic, and I am sure 
            <br>0228&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             they all have it. They 
            <br>0229&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             are all reverent. 
            <br>0230&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I think a cultivated 
            <br>0231&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             imagination and a 
            <br>0232&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             delicate — or unsmothered
            <br>0233&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             conscience are the diamond 
            <br>0234&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             shield against evil. 
            <br>0235&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Julian's memory scintillates 
            <br>0236&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             with high, heroic thoughts 
            <br>0237&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and deeds. His father 
            <br>0238&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             put into him, reading 
            <br>0239&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             aloud, every noble story 
            <br>0240&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of literature. He has 
            <br>0241&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             therefore kept the 
            <br>0242&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             highest society — and 
            <br>0243&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             has no love for

            <br>0252&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <br>0255&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             owing to her carelessness —
            <br>0256&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

             if they were torn out

            4<sup>th</sup>
            <br>0290&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             The reason I do not
            <br>0291&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             fancy Mrs Pugh is because
            <br>0292&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             she disenchanted herself
            <br>0293&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             by her artificialness and
            <br>0294&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             an effect of unveritable
            <br>0295&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            ness. At first I went
            <br>0296&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             upon your impression
            <br>0297&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of her, and your talk of
            <br>0298&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             her to me. But very
            <br>0299&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             soon she became
            <br>0300&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              [oppressive?]  and sultry
            <br>0301&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and not genuine to
            <br>0302&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             me. And I declare I
            <br>0303&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             cannot help this.
            <br>0304&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             It is her fault, not
            <br>0305&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             mine. No reasoning
            <br>0306&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             no developments of
            <br>0307&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             her life will help it.
            <br>0308&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Every person must stand
            <br>0309&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             or fall upon their character
            <br>0310&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             as evidenced by their
            <br>0311&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             presences.  It is a
            <br>0312&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             law of the universe
            <br>0313&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and no talk will alter it.

             Mr. &amp; Mrs. Turner, of
            <br>0316&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             whom you speak very
            <br>0317&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              [Sneeringly?]  because they
            <br>0318&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             are single, simple, true,
            <br>0319&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             lovely and refined —
            <br>0320&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             These are very good
            <br>0321&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             reasons, and very good
            <br>0322&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             qualities.

             I am sorry I have

             no drawings for your
            <br>0325&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             babies this week.
            <br>0326&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             But I have been
            <br>0327&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             overwhemed [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
             since

            <br>0331&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I have had to

             neglect many things —
            <br>0333&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            stationer's mark.
            
            <br>0334&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             as their needs.
            <br>0335&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I have the comfort of
            <br>0336&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             a perfect peace and

             order &amp; intelligence
            <br>0338&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             in the kitchen — for
            <br>0339&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             which I am most
            <br>0340&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             thankful — for I
            <br>0341&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             dreaded Ann's going
            <br>0342&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             to California— away
            <br>0343&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             from me. There are
            <br>0344&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             other treasures, I
            <br>0345&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             find among the
            <br>0346&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              [Irish?]  besides her.
            <br>0347&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Indeed I knew this

             but feared not to
            <br>0349&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             become possessed
            <br>0350&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of them.

            <br>0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Oh Elisabeth, your letter of Nov 12 came 
            <br>0005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             yesterday noon, after immense longing 
            <br>0006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             on my part to hear from you about 
            <br>0007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Horace particularly, and now alas the
            <br>0008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            beloved child has passed into the
            <br>0009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            heavens. From the delay of the letter,
            <br>0010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I had great fears that either Horace
            <br>0011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            or Mary were very ill, and that you
            <br>0012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            waited to give me good news. I am 
            <br>0013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            deeply grieved, and notwithstanding 
            <br>0014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            your precaution in preparing the
            <br>0015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            way to tell me finally that he was
            <br>0016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "still forever." I was smitten to the
            <br>0017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            heart when I came to that; for I 
            <br>0018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            began to think you told me the details 
            <br>0019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            of his illness as the "sad news" and that 
            <br>0020&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            he lived yet here below. Fortunately
            <br>0021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            the blow made me burst into tears 
            <br>0022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and sobs, (a very rare thing for me now)
            <br>0023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            so that the acute pang did not hurt me
            <br>0024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            so much. But I am in the greatest
            <br>0025&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            anxiety about Mary. The world has 
            <br>0026&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            lost a rare person. Where will you find 
            <br>0027&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            such fidelity, such devotion, such earnestness, 
            <br>0028&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            such perseverance, such solemn 
            <br>0029&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            dedication of the talents God has given.
            <br>0030&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I loved him greatly, and my respect 
            <br>0031&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            for his life was profound. I mourn
            <br>0032&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            for my dear Horace with deepest 
            <br>0033&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            sorrow. I did hope to persuade him 
            <br>0034&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to come to us in Dresden for recreation, 
            <br>0035&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            change and observation of the gains 
            <br>0036&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            of science here. He was so large in
            <br>0037&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            his scope. When I asked him once
            <br>0038&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            which branch of science he preferred
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;2
               &nbsp;(<a href="Letter5_P2.jpg" target="_blank">click to open page image in a new window</a>)]</span>
            
            <br>0039&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            he looked at me with surprise and replied
            <br>0040&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "How can I like one branch of science better
            <br>0041&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            than another?" True enough — how can 
            <br>0042&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            anyone — and yet, how few have this 
            <br>0043&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            broad love, and how many keep in 
            <br>0044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            one groove. His was indeed the genuine 
            <br>0045&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            love for the widest knowledge. His 
            <br>0046&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            magnificent purposes and hopes 
            <br>0047&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            probably needed another sphere to 
            <br>0048&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            be fulfilled, for oh Elisabeth, I
            never
            <br>0049&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            believed that Horace would live to 
            <br>0050&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            the prime of manhood in this world. 
            <br>0051&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I was sure he would die young, and 
            <br>0052&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            so I am not surprised, however much 
            <br>0053&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I grieve. He had not robustness of 
            <br>0054&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            constitution enough to bear such  [constant?] 
            <br>0055&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and profound study. He told me once 
            <br>0056&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             he was never for one moment rested,
            <br>0057&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and never expected to be! He worked 
            <br>0058&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             with pure spirit always, and not 
            <br>0059&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             with physical power. Even his 
            <br>0060&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             enormous walks and climbings 
            <br>0061&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and reachings in America and 
            <br>0062&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             the Sandwich Islands<a id="psandwich" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nsandwich" class="annotation" title="The Hawaiian Islands.."><sup>8</sup></a> and everywhere, 
            <br>0063&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             were accomplished because his 
            <br>0064&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             will and wish were so omnipotent—
            <br>0065&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             not because he had bodily force 
            <br>0066&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             enough. It was sublime and 
            <br>0067&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             beautiful to a degreehardly
            <br>0068&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             surpassed. I feel honored that I 
            <br>0069&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             was related to him. I think there
            <br>0070&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             never was a purer sacrifice offered 
            <br>0071&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             to disinterested science. He was a 
            <br>0072&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             martyr without stain. When I saw 
            <br>0073&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             him first with the seal of death on  ↓ his ↑ 
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;3
               &nbsp;(<a href="Letter5_P3.jpg" target="_blank">click to open page image in a new window</a>)]</span>
            
            <br>0074&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             brow (as I know) it was astonishing to 
            <br>0075&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             observe the fine beauty of his face—
            <br>0076&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             the intellectual dignity suddenly
            <br>0077&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            increased so much. Julian remarked 
            <br>0078&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            yesterday that when he bade him 
            <br>0079&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            goodbye on the eve before we left Boston 
            <br>0080&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            that he had never seen him look 
            <br>0081&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            so well—(meaning so fine in expression) 
            <br>0082&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Ah it is we only who are disappointed! 
            <br>0083&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and lamenting— For just think of him 
            <br>0084&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            now with no obstruction between him 
            <br>0085&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and the universe of God. Think how 
            <br>0086&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            his face shines with eternal joy as 
            <br>0087&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            he apprehends the secrets of creation. 
            <br>0088&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            If he had had a stronger body and 
            <br>0089&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            tougher health, he would doubtless 
            <br>0090&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have lost in delicacy of perception 
            <br>0091&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and acute sensibility to all the
            <br>0092&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            mysterious laws and results of Nature. 
            <br>0093&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Also in living here among less
            <br>0094&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            exalted persons  ↑ in his vocation ↓  he might have 
            <br>0095&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            finally merged spirit in the matter 
            <br>0096&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            that is  ↑  also  ↓ so wonderful and fine. 
            <br>0097&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            He was too susceptible of suffering for 
            <br>0098&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            those who loved him vitally, to really 
            <br>0099&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            enjoy his progress. I was always in
            <br>0100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            terror of the sudden breaking down 
            <br>0101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            of overtaxed brain and nerves.
            <br>0102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I thank God he did not lose his 
            <br>0103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            reason under the pressure of his cares. 
            <br>0104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Oh how much better that he should 
            <br>0105&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            enter into endless Rest than to 
            <br>0106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            merely exist ↑  here  ↓  without use of reason. 
            <br>0107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            That would surely have broken our hearts.

            <br>0108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             But he entered the mansion prepared 
            <br>0109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             for him in his  ↑ Heavenly ↓  Father's House, living
            <br>0110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and conscious through all his being. 
            <br>0111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Were not the words he first heard

            <q>well done,  ↑ Thou 
               good and  ↓ faithful servant. Thou hast 
               <br>0113&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                been faithful over a few things. I will 
               <br>0114&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                make thee ruler over many things!
               <br>0115&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

             rise to his father's most ardent 
            <br>0137&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             prayers for him? I am comforting 
            <br>0138&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             myself —; How I wish I could comfort 
            <br>0139&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Mary. God alone can speak to her. 
            <br>0140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I do not know what it is to lose a son. 
            <br>0141&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             God bless and help her, as He surely will.
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;5

            <br>0142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Her remarkable fortitude will aid her 
            <br>0143&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             now, and also her generous tenderness. 
            <br>0144&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I hope she will live for the others. 
            <br>0145&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             She said once she wished to live till 
            <br>0146&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Ben was 21. I hope she will not 
            <br>0147&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             be drawn up into the blessed land 
            <br>0148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             after Horace, and I think she will
            <br>0149&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             stay for the rest. She has such 
            <br>0150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             identity of life with her children, 
            <br>0151&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             that I cannot conceive of their doing 
            <br>0152&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             without her on earth. If Horace could 
            <br>0153&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             miss any thing in a state, the felicity 
            <br>0154&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of which eye hath not seen nor 
            <br>0155&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             ear heard, it would be his mother's 
            <br>0156&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             embracing care. But he has that 
            <br>0157&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             still, and all else superadded, and
            <br>0158&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             as I first exclaimed with sobs 
            <br>0159&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and tears <q>He never will be tired any 
               <br>0160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                more!</q> Human power could never
            <br>0161&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             compass what he meant to do, and 
            <br>0162&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             not to disappoint him, His Heavenly 
            <br>0163&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Father took him from earthly 
            <br>0164&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             obstacles and constant suffering, 
            <br>0165&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             where he can never more be cold 
            <br>0166&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             nor weary nor interrupted in his 
            <br>0167&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             immortal course of knowledge 
            <br>0168&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and aspiration. Two witnesses 
            <br>0169&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             have George and Ben now 
            <br>0170&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             in heaven —; Two angels to watch and 
            <br>0171&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             ward. I trust you have written 
            <br>0172&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             again to tell me how they do and 
            <br>0173&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             how they bear it. But of Mary 
            <br>0174&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I am most fearful, because she 
            <br>0175&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             is frail, and had lately been so ill.
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;6
               &nbsp;(<a href="Letter5_P6.jpg" target="_blank">click to open page image in a new window</a>)]</span>
            
            <br>0176&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             She has such strength of endurance that 
            <br>0177&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I believe she will live here as long 
            <br>0178&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             as she desires to live, because also 
            <br>0179&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             her wish to live is so unselfish. 
            <br>0180&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             She wishes to live for her children 
            <br>0181&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and not for herself. Perhaps by and
            
            <br>0182&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             by I can write to her, but how could 
            <br>0183&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I speak to her now. I am dumb
            <br>0184&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             before her in this terrible moment.
            
            
            <br>0185&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I think with satisfaction of what
            <br>0186&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             is very trifling to others —; but not to 
            <br>0187&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             me. It is that Horace was always
            <br>0188&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             very affectionate and sweet to me 
            <br>0189&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I remember his grasp of hand 
            <br>0190&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and his smile whenever I met 
            <br>0191&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             him —-; and whenever he said <q>Aunt
               <br>0192&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Sophia</q>—; was always moved, each 
            <br>0193&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             time, as if he first said it then. 
            <br>0194&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I also remember well what a respect 
            <br>0195&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and regard my husband had for 
            <br>0196&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             him. He always liked to talk 
            <br>0197&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             with him and to hear everything 
            <br>0198&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             he said. His sincerity, seriousness
            <br>0199&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of purpose and varied knowledge 
            <br>0200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and intelligence made him 
            <br>0201&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             so attractive to Mr. Hawthorne —; 
            <br>0202&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and in his presence there was such 
            <br>0203&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             a modest dignity of manners —; 
            <br>0204&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             so thoughtful an air of 
            <br>0205&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             conscientious consideration as 
            <br>0206&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             was truly beautiful.
            
            
            <br><br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;7
               &nbsp;(<a href="Letter5_P7.jpg" target="_blank">click to open page image in a new window</a>)]</span>
            
            <br>0207&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             I believe the last time I saw him 
            <br>0208&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             in Concord was when he came in
            <br>0209&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             loaded with lovely arethusas —; and 
            <br>0210&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             presented me with a radiant 
            <br>0211&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             sheaf of them. I was always thankful 
            <br>0212&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             to see him come —; but how seldom 
            <br>0213&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             he came. I felt he could not waste 
            <br>0214&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             his time, for seldom anyone so 
            <br>0215&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             impressed me with the value of 
            <br>0216&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             moments. He never wasted any
            <br>0217&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             time! What a marvel! Not since 
            <br>0218&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             childhood, when he began to try 
            <br>0219&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             chemic experiments. How thoroughly 
            <br>0220&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             he obeyed the command<q>Work while 
               <br>0221&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                it is day —</q>;
            
            
            <br>0222&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             When he came home from the 
            <br>0223&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Sandwich Islands, there was a knot of 
            <br>0224&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             pain on his brow, which did not wear 
            <br>0225&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             quite away till I saw the seal of
            <br>0226&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             death take its place. I always 
            <br>0227&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             wondered what had troubled him. 
            <br>0228&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Perhaps he has now told his mother —; 
            <br>0229&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             but I am sure he had some great 
            <br>0230&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             trouble which he thought best to 
            <br>0231&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             keep to himself. I sometimes 
            <br>0232&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             thought I would ask him to tell 
            <br>0233&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             me, as he might be reluctant to 
            <br>0234&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             disturb his mother —; for I thought 
            <br>0235&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             he would feel better to relieve 
            <br>0236&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             himself of it, whatever he was. 
            <br>0237&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             It is no matter now —-; for when
            <br>0238&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             the golden gate turned  ↑ back ↓  on its

            <br>0241&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             outside, and his brow now is [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] 
             ↑ smooth ↓ 
            <br>0242&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             with peace. I begin today to be
            <br>0243&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             conscious of his peace —; I could think
            <br>0244&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of only Mary's loss and the loss of
            <br>0245&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             us all at first. Today I have written
            <br>0246&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             myself into an ecstasy with his gain
            <br>0247&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             and relief and I wish I could know
            <br>0248&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             soon about Mary. No doubt a letter
            <br>0249&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             is on its way to me now. This one
            <br>0250&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             of yours may have been at Thode's
            <br>0251&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             a few days. Do not send any more
            <br>0252&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

             You have received four letters from me
            <br>0260&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             before this time —; the three last were
            <br>0261&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             announcements. I will write again

             I should like some money very much. I

             was to have some from Ticknor &amp; Fields

            <br>0266&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             the firm is dissolved. If so, perhaps I
            <br>0267&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             am without redress. I wish Mr Hillard
            <br>0268&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             could send my January dividend so I
            <br>0269&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             can have it by 1st January. What he

            About this View of the Journal
            </h2>
         <hr>
         <p><a id="view"></a>This presentation of the Hawthorne letters derives from the
            project's main XML file, hawthorne_letters.xml, transformed with hawthorne_view_common.xsl
            and
            hawthorne_view_diplomatic.xsl. In the text of the letter, line and page breaks follow
            those in
            the manuscript; paragraph breaks are not reported. Spelling, punctuation, capitalization,
            and
            abbreviations are reported as they appear in the manuscript. Text highlighted by Hawthorne
            with an underscore is underscored. Text canceled by Hawthorne is presented in a red,
            strikethrough font. Uncertain readings are enclosed in square brackets and followed
            by a
            question mark. Text added by Hawthorne between lines is preceded by an arrow indicating
            whether the addition is above or below the line and followed by an arrow indicating
            the return
            to the line (↑ ↓); text added in the margins is preceded and followed by a
            vertical bar (|). Text added by Hawthorne in the margins is surrounded by "pipe"
            characters (|) at the point in the main text that it appears to follow. Links to external
            materials are colored and underlined.</p>
