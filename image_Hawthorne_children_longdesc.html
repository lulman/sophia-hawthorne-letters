        <title>Photograph of Una, Julian, and Rose Hawthorne.</title>
    </head>
    <body><p>Full-length, formal portrait photograph of Una, Julian, and Rose Hawthorne against a mostly plain background save for heavy curtain pulled partially back along the left edge. The children surround a small draped table. Una, the eldest, sits in the front resting her left elbow on the table. Julian stands behind, resting his left hand on the table. Rose, the youngest, stands to the right of the frame, resting her right hand on the table. All three children gaze unsmiling off to the left of the viewer.</p>
