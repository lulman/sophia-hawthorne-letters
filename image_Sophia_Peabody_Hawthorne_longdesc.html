    <body><p>Black-and-white reproduction of a head-and-shoulders portrait of an adult Sophia Peabody Hawthorne against a white background with shading to the right and left of her face. She is wearing a white, high-collared dress and tightly curled dark hair parted in the middle, and she gazes unsmiling past her right shoulder directly at the viewer.</p>
