           <p>"My  Dear Elizabeth: Letters from Sophia Peabody Hawthorne to Elizabeth Palmer Peabody,  
             1837-1868" is an electronic edition of five letters written  by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne (1809-1871) 
             to her sister Elizabeth  Palmer Peabody (1804-1894).</p>

           <p>Encoding of the Hawthorne letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental
             information allowing for semi-modernized, corrected, regularized, or expanded views included as 
             the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, recoverable
             cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
             have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
             versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
             attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.</p>
           <p>Corrections and emendations in Hawthorne's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear 
             or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake 
             of clarity and encoded with the TEI &lt;supplied&gt; element.</p>
           <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation
             and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and 
             signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.</p>
           <p>The critical apparatus used in particular views of the letters is explained at the bottom of each view.</p>
           <p>The XML and XSL files related to this
             edition are all available in the KB.

           <p>The TEI elements for the individual letters that constitute this edition of Sophia Hawthorne's letters
             are provided with xml:id values that reflect the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming
             convention: SPH_YYYYMMDD. Dates of composition were determined from
             various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal
             evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars.</p>
           <p>The value of @facs elements related to each image that accompanies this edition
             consist of the filename of 
             the corresponding page image and a "view" designation for pages on which
             text is written in two or more orientations.</p>

                <!-- SHORT SUMMARY OF CONTENTS from <front><head><p> -->
                In this letter, Sophia Peabody attempts to correct misunderstandings between herself and her sister 
                Elizabeth regarding Sophia's estimation of Abigail May Alcott [Mrs. Bronson Alcott] and, more generally, 
                the sisters' differing attitudes toward "fault-finding." Before mailing the letter to Elizabeth, Sophia gives it 
                to her sister Mary, who adds her own perspective on the misunderstanding, asking for sympathy 
                and peace as well as communicating her frustrations with both of her sisters.

          <p>
            <lb/> I have just read your long letter. 
            <lb/> I cannot wait a moment before disabusing you 
            <lb/> of one entire<del hand="#SPH" type="overstrike">ly</del> mistake, which is your impres<seg type="softhyphen">‐</seg><lb/>sion of my estimation of <name key="AMA" type="person">Mrs. Alcott</name>
            <seg>
              <note target="#AMA" anchored="true">2</note>
            </seg>. You <hi rend="underline">never</hi>
            
            <lb/> heard me express for her a want of respect 
            <lb/> or love, for from the beginning &amp; through all 
            <lb/> I have thought her a sort of sublime phe<seg type="softhyphen">‐</seg><lb/>nomenon — a terrible power made up of 
            <lb/>divinest tenderness— vast humanity — infinite
            <lb/> self sacrifice — a perfect juggernaut devotion 
            <lb/> to the Right. I have loved her dearly always.
            <lb/> How can you think otherwise<choice><sic>.</sic><corr>?</corr></choice> Don't you remember 
            <lb/> at that time my sympathy with her — &amp; afterwards 
            <lb/> my writing often to her, &amp; ever since the affectionate 
            <lb/> way in which we have ever met<choice><sic>.</sic><corr>?</corr></choice> I have always 
            <lb/> felt the utmost tenderness for her. I scarcely 
            <lb/> ever saw a person who seemed to me so full 
            <lb/> of pathos — amounting to the fearful. I am at a
            <lb/> loss to imagine how you have such an idea in 
            <lb/> your mind. Does it not show what complete,
            <lb/> misunderstandings may exist —<add hand="#SPH" place="supralinear"> I <hi rend="underline">never</hi> thought her deformed, </add> never moved by earthly passion.
          </p><p>
            <lb/> I had a long talk with <name key="MTPM" type="person">Mary</name>

            </seg> the other 
            <lb/> evening about this discussing of people's faults. 
            <lb/> She said she never before understood what
            <lb/> I meant, &amp; she did not believe you did.
            <lb/> It is not that I do not see people do wrong — &amp; that 
            <lb/> therefore I necessarily am unjust — but I have 
            <lb/> understood Christ to teach that if each one looked 
            <lb/> only to his own errors, perhaps there would be <choice><sic>juster</sic><corr>more just</corr></choice>
            <lb/> judgment &amp; greater improvement in individuals. 
            <lb/> When he speaks plainly I prefer to understand 
            <lb/> him plainly, for I find it the most fruitful 
            <lb/> of good. It has not been a personal feeling 
            <lb/> for particular persons — for <name key="ABA" type="person">Mr. Alcott</name>

            <lb/> mistakes are made in sweeping or even in what
            <lb/> seem cool, rational judgments of others. 
            <lb/> But as the seeing mind cannot but observe 
            <lb/> I have thought that each person had better

            <lb/> the influx of more light. Then no one would 
            <lb/> be so cruelly wronged as some are — &amp; there 
            <lb/> would be more time &amp; room for the interchange 
            <lb/> of thought about things which are eternal —
            <lb/> Christ might say <q>Woe unto you, hypocrites!</q> Because 
            <lb/> there was no mote in his eye to take out,<seg>
              <note target="#n1" anchored="true">5</note>
            </seg> &amp; he 
            <lb/> could see with<del hand="#SPH" type="overstrike">out</del> clear vision, what was in 
            <lb/> man, but it is not so with the less exalted. 
            <lb/> I have said to myself Oh let me enjoy &amp; speak 
            <lb/> of the good I see —
            <lb/> &amp; be silent of the evil I see. 
            <lb/>You <del hand="#SPH" type="overstrike">have</del>&amp; <name key="MTPM" type="person">Mary</name> have thought me morbid about 
            <lb/> hearing certain people spoken of — I always knew
            <lb/> this was not the truth. It was not the person 
            <lb/> but the thing that I struggled against. 
            <lb/> Even when I have mutely listened, I have 
            <lb/> always had a mental reservation that perhaps 
            <lb/> it was not so — for GOD alone could see the heart —
            <lb/> &amp; comprehend all the grounds upon which it 
            <lb/> acted. I can see good in being openeyed
            <lb/>&amp; not acting with a rash confidence — but I
            <lb/> suspect I shall live forever &amp; not see good

            <lb/>in dwelling upon personal faults. For my life
            <lb/>I <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi>
            <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> the least use in talking
            <lb/>about them. I never hear of a great crime
            <lb/>committed that I do not wish I had a hundred
            <lb/>thousand arms &amp; powers to guard the person
            <lb/>from being utterly condemned, because no <del hand="#SPH" type="overwritten">one</del>man
            <lb/>can know the tragedy, the struggle, the woe,
            <lb/>the misery of the being's inward life who
            <lb/>transgressed—and it is an infinite comfort to me
            <lb/>always to know that GOD knows all &amp; will accordingly
            <lb/>award with infinite tenderness— &amp; allow for <del hand="#SPH" type="overstrike">all</del>
            <lb/>want of light. A murder which horrifies the
            <lb/>community never seems to me so dreadful or wrong
            <lb/>in the eye of Heaven as the animadversions of
            <lb/>those who think they are more righteous than the
            <lb/>murderer. <hi rend="underline">Nevertheless</hi>, I can <del hand="#SPH" type="overwritten">s</del> certainly suppose

            <lb/>this matter, &amp; that you do your duty in a way
            <lb/>of proceeding, which with my idea—it would
            <lb/>manifestly be wrong for me to adopt.

            <lb/>more harm than good to talk about them—
            <lb/>because I know it is impossible for an intelligent

              <lb/> in her crying now if there ever was—it
              <lb/> is pure <add hand="#SPH" place="supralinear">physical</add> agony — but she only apprehends now
              <lb/> that it will be perhaps difficult to appear
              <lb/> natural, at least for a time &amp; that you
              <lb/> will misconstrue that. I have assured
              <lb/> her that you will allow for that, and now
