                three. Their letters intertwined, so that reading only Sophia’s side of a
                correspondence, for example, would give only a partial view</q> (Marshall, "Epilogue" 249).</p>

        <p>"My Dear Elizabeth: Letters from Sophia Peabody Hawthorne to Elizabeth Palmer Peabody,
          1837-1868" is an electronic edition of five letters written by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne
          (1809-1871) to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody (1804-1894). The edition belongs to a
          series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of previously unpublished
          nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library
          (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions include "Selected Entries
          from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries, 30 July 1862 to 31 December 1862"; "Selected Letters from the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of 
          Stephens Family Travel Letters and Ephemera"; "William B. Anderson's Civil War Correspondence, 1862-1864"; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by Samuel
          Sullivan Cox; and Louisa A. Doane's "Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853)."</p>
           
           <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
             on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
             English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
             opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
             cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
             databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
             what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
             represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
             reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
             students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell us
             about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
           
           <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
             explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
             the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
             and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
             that shape particular interpretations and presentations of texts; and the mediation of
             electronic delivery systems.</p>
           
           <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
             need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing or
             the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
             the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
             Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
             broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
             example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
             historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
             case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
             need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
             archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
             matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
             the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
             original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
             the source texts. In the case of the Hawthorne letters, we have edited all five of
             Sophia Hawthorne's letters in the RBMS collection.</p>
           
           <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
             representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access to
             manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with a
             variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>
           
           <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
             the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
             consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
             structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
             repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
             However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
             revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.</p>

             <emph rend="bold">Scanning</emph>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF images
             at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
             quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
             preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
             produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
             Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
             provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.. 
           </p>
           
           <p><emph rend="bold">Transcription</emph>. Editing of the Hawthorne letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription: 
             abbreviations, recoverable cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underlining, additions above and below
             the line or in the margins, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
             have all been transcribed and encoded, to the best of the editors' ability, as they appear in the original manuscripts
             (punctuation and capitalization often can be especially difficult to disambiguate). The
             representation of those features varies depending on the view of the letter. An explanation of 
             the presentation in each view of the letters can be read via the "About this View" link
             at the top of each view's page.</p>
           
           <p><emph rend="bold">Markup and Annotation</emph>. XML encoding of the Hawthorne letters follows The
             Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <title level="m">P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</title>,
             as customized for the project using the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process.
             This editorial introduction and the three "views" of the letters were generated from the main XML file
             using XSL transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were encoded in HTML separately.
             A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the "Appendices" menu, and all source files
             (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and downloaded via the "Source Files" menu.</p>
           
           <p>Introductory material (such as this editorial introduction) as well as annotated lists of people, places, 
             and organizations mentioned in the letters are encoded in the TEI header of the main XML
             document. Other explanatory annotations are linked directly from the text. Separate appendices provide 
             further information about the project (e.g., acknowledgements, editors' bios, and so on). 
             All these ancillary materials can be viewed via the menus at the top of each page.</p>
           
           <p>
             <emph rend="bold">Proofing</emph>. Students who created the original transcriptions proofread their own
             transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by NINES and preservation in The Ohio State University's 
             Knowledge Bank, the transcriptions and encoding were once again proofread by Professor Ulman.
           </p>
           <p>
             <emph rend="bold">Peer Review</emph>. Anonymous reviewers for NINES provided peer-reviews for the editions, in response to 
             which they were revised and then reviewed by NINES editors before being listed in the NINES database.

                In this letter, Sophia Peabody attempts to correct misunderstandings between herself and her sister 
                Elizabeth regarding Sophia's estimation of Abigail May Alcott [Mrs. Bronson Alcott] and, more generally, 
                the sisters' differing attitudes toward "fault-finding." Before mailing the letter to Elizabeth, Sophia gives it 
                to her sister Mary, who adds her own perspective on the misunderstanding, asking for sympathy 
                and peace as well as communicating her frustrations with both of her sisters.

                year [1837], 4 pp., 4to, with 2 pp. crossed, and folded, to make an address sheet.
                With palimsestic postcript by "M" (Sophia Hawthorne's sister, Mary). Because of the
                complexity of cross-writing and marginal continuations that sometimes spread across
                different pages of the bifolium, the "By MS Page" and "Facsimile/Text" views of this
                edition organize the letter by sequential sections rather than pages, "sections"
                defined as blocks of text oriented similarly on the page. To help readers envision
                the complex layout of the text, we provide the following diagrams of the front and
                back of the bifolium: <figure rend="link">
                  <head>[Letter 1 Sections, Pages 1 and 4]</head>
                  <graphic url="./Letter1_Diagram_Front.jpg"/>

                  <figDesc> Letter 1 Sections, Pages 2 and 3 </figDesc>
                </figure>. The sisters presumably employed cross-writing and filled the sheet
                edge-to-edge by writing in the margins in part because at the time, postage rates
                were based on the number of sheets and the distance a letter would travel—the U.S.
                Postal Service adopted stamps in 1847 ("Stamps and Postcards"). The
                unlined, cream-colored paper bears an embossed watermark near the fold. A red,
                broken wax seal has torn the page where it was folded over for mailing, resulting in
                gaps in the text in sections 3 and 7. </p>

            <lb/><salute>My Dear <persName ref="#EPP">Elizabeth</persName>,</salute>
          </opener>
          <p>
            <lb/> I have just read your long letter. 
            <lb/> I cannot wait a moment before disabusing you 
            <lb/> of one entire<del hand="#SPH" rend="overstrike">ly</del> mistake, which is your
            impres<seg type="softhyphen">‐
            <lb/></seg>sion of my estimation of <name key="AMA" type="person">Mrs. Alcott</name>. You <hi rend="underlined">never</hi>
            <lb/> heard me express for her a want of respect or
            <lb/> love; for from the beginning &amp; through all 
            <lb/> I have thought her a sort of sublime phe<seg type="softhyphen">‐</seg><lb/>nomenon — a terrible power made up of 
            <lb/>divinest tenderness— vast humanity — infinite
            <lb/> self sacrifice — a perfect juggernaut devotion 
            <lb/> to the Right. I have loved her dearly always.
            <lb/> How can you think otherwise. Don't you remember 
            <lb/> at th<del rend="overwritten">e</del>at time my sympathy with her — &amp; afterwards 
            <lb/> my writing often to her, &amp; ever since the affectionate 
            <lb/> way in which we have ever met. I have always 
            <lb/> felt the utmost tenderness for her. I scarcely 
            <lb/> ever saw a person who seemed to me so full 
            <lb/> of pathos — amounting to the fearful. I am at a
            <lb/> loss to imagine how you have such an idea in 
            <lb/> your mind. Does it not show what complete,
            <lb/> misunderstandings may exist —<add hand="#SPH" place="supralinear"> I <hi rend="underlined">never</hi> thought her deformed, </add> never moved by earthly passion.
          </p><p>
            <lb/> I had a long talk with <name key="MTPM" type="person">Mary</name> the other 
            <lb/> evening about this discussing of people's faults. 
            <lb/> She said she never before understood what
            <lb/> I meant, &amp; she did not believe you did.
            <lb/> It is not that I do not see people do wrong — &amp; that 
            <lb/> therefore I necessarily am unjust — but I have 
            <lb/> understood Christ to teach that if each one looked 
            <lb/> only to his own errors, <add place="supralinear"><unclear>perhaps</unclear></add> there would be <choice><sic>juster</sic><corr>more just</corr></choice>
            <lb/> judgment &amp; greater improvement in individuals. 
            <lb/> When he speaks plainly I prefer to understand 
            <lb/> him plainly, for I find it the most fruitful 
            <lb/> of good. It has not been a personal feeling 
            <lb/> for particular persons — for <name key="ABA" type="person">Mr. Alcott</name> for instance, 
            <lb/> but this general principle, which would make
            <lb/> me feel the same if a person I never knew
            
            <!-- Section 2 -->
            <pb facs="Letter1_P2a"/>
            
            <lb/> were analysed &amp; decided upon. I know 
            <lb/> that GOD only can know a person truly, 
            <lb/> from my own experience, &amp; I know that immense 
            <lb/> mistakes are made in sweeping or even in what
            <lb/> seem cool, rational judgments of others. 
            <lb/> But as the seeing mind cannot but observe 
            <lb/> I have thought that each person had better 
            <lb/> not <add hand="#SPH" place="supralinear">by <hi rend="underline">talking</hi>
            </add> emphasize bad opinions of men —<gap extent="one word" reason="cancelled and illegible" rend="overwritten"/> arguing 
            <lb/> pronouncing &amp; deciding upon their motives &amp; actions, 
            <lb/> which ever must be somewhat in the dark —
            <lb/> but let the opinion be constantly modified
            <lb/> or changed <add hand="#SPH" place="supralinear">in the mind</add> by the evolving of circumstances &amp; 
            <lb/> the influx of more light. Then no one would 
            <lb/> be so cruelly wronged as some are — &amp; there 
            <lb/> would be more time &amp; room for the interchange 
            <lb/> of thought about things which are eternal —
            <lb/> Christ might say <q>Woe unto you, hypocrites!</q> because 
            <lb/> there was no mote in his eye to take out,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="mote"/><note resp="ed" xml:id="mote">See Matt. 7: 3-5.</note> &amp; he 
            <lb/> could see with<del hand="#SPH" rend="overstrike">out</del> clear vision, what was in 
            <lb/> man, but it is not so with the less exalted. 
            <lb/> I have said to myself Oh let me enjoy &amp; speak 
            <lb/> of the good I see — &amp; be silent of the evil I see. 
            <lb/>You <del hand="#SPH" rend="overstrike">have</del> &amp; <name key="MTPM" type="person">Mary</name> have thought me morbid about 
            <lb/> hearing certain people spoken of — I always knew
            <lb/> this was not the truth. It was not the person 
            <lb/> but the thing that I struggled against. 
            <lb/> Even when I have mutely listened, I have 
            <lb/> always had a mental reservation that perhaps 
            <lb/> it was not so — for GOD alone could see the heart —
            <lb/> &amp; comprehend all the grounds upon which it 
            <lb/> acted. I can see good in being openeyed
            <lb/>&amp; not acting with a rash confidence — but I
            <lb/> suspect I shall live forever &amp; not see good

            <lb/>thousand arms &amp; powers to guard the person
            <lb/>from being utterly condemned, because no <del hand="#SPH" rend="overwritten">one</del>man

            <lb/>the misery of the being's inward life who

            <lb/>so firmly fastened round his neck
            <lb/>that I thought he would never
            <lb/>let the Angel go — even after he

            <lb/>he relaxed his hold. Then <name type="person"> Mr

              <lb/>have seen him for the world. It
              <lb/>was worth coming just to look at
              <lb/>him. He never looked so handsome
              <lb/>in his life. There is no distortion
              <lb/>there. All is right. All is right.</q>
            <lb/>I cannot tell you all he said now.
            <lb/>Oh he is the most helpful — the

            <lb/>

          <p> I am really

              <lb/>to say that the Roman
              <lb/>fever seems to have been
              <lb/>arrested in her — for she
              <lb/>has had no chills for two
              <lb/>days. She is a lily now,
              <lb/>her lifelong roses snatched
              <lb/>away, but during these
              <lb/>two days I have thought
              <lb/>to see a dawn of roses
              <lb/>in her cheeks and lips,
              <lb/>though she is now suffering
              <lb/>from influenza.

<lb/> and out of a hundred

<lb/> We could not take 
<lb/> advantage of the free
<lb/> lessons of <persName>Dr. Kinner</persName>
<lb/> for <persName ref="#UHawthorne">Una</persName>, on account
<lb/> partly <del hand="#SPHawthorne" rend="overwritten">and</del>of the expense

<lb/> there were other reasons 
<lb/>less imperative. I 
<lb/>am very sorry, but

<lb/> since there is not 
<lb/> literally money enough 
<lb/> for it — I accept the 
<lb/> disappointment. For it 
<lb/> is certainly a very plain 
<lb/> duty not to spend other
<lb/> peoples' money for 
<lb/> accomplishments — <add hand="#SPHawthorne" place="supralinear" rend="caret">or any thing else.</add> And as 
<lb/> we are very closely pressed 
<lb/> this year — and feel it 
<lb/> important not to grind 
<lb/> <persName ref="#JHawthorne">Julian</persName> too closely in
<lb/> college, (though he must 
<lb/> be exceedingly economical 
<lb/> at the best) — we must 
<lb/> all sacrifice a great

<lb/> When I do not answer

          <p>
<lb/> Oh <persName ref="#EPPeabody">Elizabeth</persName>, your letter of <choice><expan>November</expan><abbr>Nov</abbr></choice> 12 came 
<lb/> yesterday noon, after immense longing 
<lb/> on my part to hear from you about 
<lb/> <persName ref="#HMannjr">Horace</persName> particularly, and now alas the
<lb/>beloved child has passed into the
<lb/>heavens. From the delay of the letter,
            <lb/>I had great fears that either <persName ref="#HMannjr">Horace</persName>
<lb/>or <persName ref="#MTPMann">Mary</persName> were very ill, and that you
<lb/>waited to give me good news. I am 
<lb/>deeply grieved, and notwithstanding 
<lb/>your precaution in preparing the
<lb/>way to tell me finally that he was
<lb/>&quot;still forever.&quot; I was smitten to the
<lb/>heart when I came to that; for I 
<lb/>began to think you told me the details 
<lb/>of his illness as the &quot;sad news&quot; and that 
<lb/>he lived yet here below. Fortunately
<lb/>the blow made me burst into tears 
<lb/>and sobs, (a very rare thing for me now)
<lb/>so that the acute pang did not hurt me
<lb/>so much. But I am in the greatest
<lb/>anxiety about <persName ref="#MTPMann">Mary</persName>. The world has 
<lb/>lost a rare person. Where will you find 
<lb/>such fidelity, such devotion, such earnestness, 
<lb/>such perseverance, such solemn 
<lb/>dedication of the talents God has given.
<lb/>I loved him greatly, and my respect 
<lb/>for his life was profound. I mourn
            <lb/>for my dear <persName ref="#HMannjr">Horace</persName> with deepest 
<lb/>sorrow. I did hope to persuade him 
<lb/>to come to us in Dresden for recreation, 
<lb/>change and observation of the gains 
<lb/>of science here. He was so large in
<lb/>his scope. When I asked him once
<lb/>which branch of science he <hi rend="underlined">preferred</hi>

<!-- Page 2 -->
<pb facs="Letter5_P2"/>
               
<lb/>he looked at me with surprise and replied
<lb/>&quot;How can I like one branch of science better
<lb/>than another?&quot; True enough — how can 
<lb/>anyone — and yet, how few have this 
<lb/>broad love, and how many keep in 
<lb/>one groove. His was indeed the genuine 
<lb/>love for the widest knowledge. His 
<lb/>magnificent purposes and hopes 
<lb/>probably needed another sphere to 
<lb/>be fulfilled, for oh <persName ref="#EPPeabody">Elizabeth</persName>, I
    <hi rend="underlined">never</hi>
<lb/>believed that <persName ref="#HMannjr">Horace</persName> would live to 
<lb/>the prime of manhood in this world. 
<lb/><hi rend="underlined">I was sure</hi> he would die young, and 
<lb/>so I am not surprised, however much 
<lb/>I grieve. He had not robustness of 
<lb/>constitution enough to bear such <unclear reason="obscured by ink stain">constant</unclear>
<lb/> and profound study. He told me once 
<lb/> he was never for one moment rested,
<lb/> and never expected to be! He worked 
<lb/> with pure spirit always, and not 
<lb/> with physical power. Even his 
<lb/> enormous walks and climbings 
<lb/> and reachings in America and 
<lb/> the Sandwich Islands and everywhere, 
<lb/> were accomplished because his 
<lb/> will and wish were so omnipotent—
<lb/> not because he had bodily force 
<lb/> enough. It was sublime and 
<lb/> beautiful to a degree <del hand="#SPHawthorne" type="overwritten"><unclear>never</unclear></del>hardly
<lb/> surpassed. I feel honored that I 
<lb/> was related to him. I think there
<lb/> never was a purer sacrifice offered 
<lb/> to disinterested science. He was a 
<lb/> martyr without stain. When I saw 
<lb/> him first with the seal of death on <add hand="#SPHawthorne" place="infralinear">his</add>

<lb/> brow (as I <hi rend="underlined">knew.</hi>) it was astonishing to 
<lb/> observe the fine beauty of his face—
<lb/> the intellectual dignity suddenly
<lb/>increased so much. <persName ref="#JHawthorne">Julian</persName> remarked 
<lb/>yesterday that when he bade him 
<lb/>goodbye on the eve before we left Boston 
<lb/>that he had never seen him look 
<lb/>so well—(meaning so fine in expression) 
<lb/>Ah it is we only who are disappointed! 
<lb/>and lamenting— For just think of him 
<lb/>now with no obstruction between him 
<lb/>and the universe of God. Think how 
<lb/>his face shines with eternal joy as 
<lb/>he apprehends the secrets of creation. 
<lb/>If he had had a stronger body and 
<lb/>tougher health, he would doubtless 
<lb/>have lost in delicacy of perception 
<lb/>and acute sensibility to all the
<lb/>mysterious laws and results of Nature. 
<lb/>Also in living here among less
<lb/>exalted persons <add hand="#SPHawthorne" place="supralinear">in his vocation</add> he might have 
<lb/>finally <del hand="#SPHawthorne" type="overwritten"><unclear></unclear></del>merged  spirit in the matter 
<lb/>that is <add hand="#SPHawthorne" place="supralinear"> also </add>so wonderful and fine. 
<lb/>He was too susceptible of suffering for 
<lb/>those who loved him vitally, to really 
<lb/>enjoy his progress. I was always in
<lb/>terror of the sudden breaking down 
<lb/>of overtaxed brain and nerves.
<lb/>I thank God he did not lose his 
<lb/>reason under the pressure of his cares. 
<lb/>Oh how much better that he should 
<lb/>enter into endless Rest than to 
<lb/>merely exist<add hand="#SPHawthorne" place="supralinear"> here </add> without use of reason. 
<lb/>That would surely have broken our hearts.

<lb/> But he entered the mansion prepared 
<lb/> for him in his <add place="supralinear" rend="caret" hand="#SPHawthorne">Heavenly</add> Father's House, living

<lb/> Were not the words he first heard 
<lb/><q>Well done, <add place="supralinear" rend="caret" hand="#SPHawthorne">Thou

<lb/> For has not he gained five talents 
<lb/> more than the five which the Lord 
<lb/> delivered unto him? Did he ever 
<lb/> fold one in a napkin? When his 
<lb/> mother's first agony of separation is 
<lb/> over, his noble life will come back 
<lb/> to her like an angel of consolation —; 
<lb/> and she will feel rewarded in a 
<lb/> celestial way for her truly divine 
<lb/> care and sympathy with him. One in 
<lb/> a thousand mothers is she, and it 
<lb/> would indeed be a pity to part such 
<lb/> love. <hi rend="underlined">It is not parted</hi>— oh no —; His 
<lb/> gratitude on earth to her could never
<lb/> reach his gratitude to her in heaven 
<lb/> where he can better appreciate <del rend="overwritten">it</del>and 
<lb/> <del rend="overwritten">and</del>understand her single devotion to 
<lb/> his highest good. And his father is 
<lb/> there to receive and welcome him 
<lb/> without a misgiving! For did not he 
<lb/> rise to his father's most ardent 
<lb/> prayers for him? I am comforting 
<lb/> myself — How I wish I could comfort 
<lb/> Mary. God alone can speak to her— 
<lb/> I do not know what it is to lose a son. 
<lb/> God bless and help her, as He surely will.

<lb/> Her remarkable fortitude will aid her 
<lb/> now, and also her generous tenderness. 
<lb/> I hope she will live for the others. 
<lb/> She said once she wished to live till 
<lb/> <persName ref="#BMann">Ben</persName> was 21. I hope she will not 
<lb/> be drawn up into the blessed land 
<lb/> after Horace, and I think she will
<lb/> stay for the rest. She has such 
<lb/> identity of life with her children, 
<lb/> that I cannot conceive of their doing 
<lb/> without her on earth. If <persName ref="#HMannjr">Horace</persName> could 
<lb/> miss any thing in a state, the felicity 
<lb/> of which eye hath not seen nor 
<lb/> ear heard, it would be his mother's 
<lb/> embracing care. But he has that 
<lb/> still, and all else superadded, and
<lb/> as I first exclaimed with sobs 
<lb/> and tears <q>He never will be tired any 
<lb/> more!</q> Human power could never
<lb/> compass what he meant to do, and 
<lb/> not to disappoint him, His Heavenly 
<lb/> Father took him from earthly 
<lb/> obstacles and constant suffering, 
<lb/> where he can never more be <hi rend="underlined">cold</hi> 
<lb/> nor weary nor interrupted in his 
<lb/> immortal course of knowledge 
<lb/> and aspiration. Two witnesses 
<lb/> have <persName ref="#GMann">George</persName> and <persName ref="#BMann">Ben</persName> now 
<lb/> in heaven — Two angels to watch and 
<lb/> ward. I trust you have written 
<lb/> again to tell me how they do and 
<lb/> how they bear it. But of Mary 
<lb/> I am most fearful, because she 
<lb/> is frail, and had lately been so ill.

<!-- Page 6 -->

<lb/> She has such strength of endurance that 
<lb/> I believe she will live here as long 
<lb/> as she desires to live, because also 
<lb/> her wish to live is so unselfish. 
<lb/> She wishes to live for her children 
<lb/> and not for herself. Perhaps by and

<lb/> by I can write to her, but how could 
<lb/> I speak to her now. I am dumb
<lb/> before her in this terrible moment.</p>

<p>
<lb/> I think with satisfaction of what
<lb/> is very trifling to others—but not to 
<lb/> me. It is that <persName ref="#HMannjr">Horace</persName> was always
<lb/> very affectionate and sweet to me 
<lb/> I remember his grasp of hand 
<lb/> and his smile whenever I met 
<lb/> him — and whenever he said <q>Aunt
<lb/> Sophia</q> — I was always moved, each 
<lb/> time, as if he first said it then. 
<lb/> I also remember well what a respect 
<lb/> and regard my husband had for 
<lb/> him. He always liked to talk 
<lb/> with him and to hear everything 
<lb/> he said. His sincerity, seriousness
<lb/> of purpose and varied knowledge 
<lb/> and intelligence made him 
<lb/> so attractive to Mr. Hawthorne— 
<lb/> and in his presence there was such 
<lb/> a modest dignity of manners— 
<lb/> so thoughtful an air of 
<lb/> conscientious consideration as 
<lb/> was truly beautiful.

<lb/> I believe the last time I saw him 
<lb/> in Concord was when he came in
<lb/> loaded with lovely arethusas — and 
<lb/> presented me with a radiant 
<lb/> sheaf of them. I was always thankful 
<lb/> to see him come — but how seldom 
<lb/> he came. I felt he could not waste 
<lb/> his time, for seldom anyone so 
<lb/> impressed me with the value of 
<lb/> moments. He never wasted any
<lb/> time! What a marvel! Not since 
<lb/> childhood, when he began to try 
<lb/> chemic experiments. How thoroughly 
<lb/> he obeyed the command <q>Work while 
<lb/> it is day —</q></p>

<p>
<lb/> When he came home from the 
<lb/> Sandwich Islands, there was a knot of 
<lb/> pain on his brow, which did not wear 
<lb/> quite away till I saw the seal of
<lb/> death take its place. I always 
<lb/> wondered what had troubled him. 
<lb/> Perhaps he has now told his mother — 
<lb/> but I am sure he had some great 
<lb/> trouble which he thought best to 
<lb/> keep to himself. I sometimes 
<lb/> thought I would ask him to tell 
<lb/> me, as he might be reluctant to 
<lb/> disturb his mother — for I thought 
<lb/> he would feel better to relieve 
<lb/> himself of it, whatever he was. 
<lb/> It is no matter now —; for when
<lb/> the golden gate turned <add place="supralinear" rend="caret">back</add> on its

<lb/> outside, and his brow now <gap extent="one word" reason="cancelled and illegible" rend="overwritten"/>
 <add hand="#SPHawthorne" place="supralinear">is smooth</add>
<lb/> with peace. I begin today to be
<lb/> conscious of his peace — I could think
<lb/> of only Mary's loss and <gap reason="illegible" rend="overwritten"></gap>the loss of
<lb/> us all at first. Today I have written
<lb/> myself into an ecstasy with his gain
<lb/> and relief and I wish I could know
<lb/> soon about Mary. No doubt a letter
<lb/> is on its way to me now. This one
<lb/> of yours may have been at Thode's
