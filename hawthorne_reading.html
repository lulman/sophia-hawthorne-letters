            In this letter, Sophia Peabody attempts to correct misunderstandings between herself
            and her sister 
            Elizabeth regarding Sophia's estimation of Abigail May Alcott [Mrs. Bronson Alcott]
            and, more generally, 
            the sisters' differing attitudes toward "fault-finding." Before mailing the letter
            to Elizabeth, Sophia gives it 
            to her sister Mary, who adds her own perspective on the misunderstanding, asking for
            sympathy 
            and peace as well as communicating her frustrations with both of her sisters.

            <br>8th August
            <br>My Dear Elizabeth,
            
            
            <p>
                I have just read your long letter. 
                I cannot wait a moment before disabusing you 
                of one entire mistake, which is your
               impression of my estimation of Mrs. Alcott. You <U>never</U>
                heard me express for her a want of respect or
                love; for from the beginning &amp; through all 
                I have thought her a sort of sublime phenomenon — a terrible power made up of 
               divinest tenderness— vast humanity — infinite
                self sacrifice — a perfect juggernaut devotion 
                to the Right. I have loved her dearly always.
                How can you think otherwise. Don't you remember 
                at that time my sympathy with her — &amp; afterwards 
                my writing often to her, &amp; ever since the affectionate 
                way in which we have ever met. I have always 
                felt the utmost tenderness for her. I scarcely 
                ever saw a person who seemed to me so full 
                of pathos — amounting to the fearful. I am at a
                loss to imagine how you have such an idea in 
                your mind. Does it not show what complete,
                misunderstandings may exist — I <U>never</U> thought her deformed,  never moved by earthly passion.
               </p>
            <p>
                I had a long talk with Mary the other 
                evening about this discussing of people's faults. 
                She said she never before understood what
                I meant, &amp; she did not believe you did.
                It is not that I do not see people do wrong — &amp; that 
                therefore I necessarily am unjust — but I have 
                understood Christ to teach that if each one looked 
                only to his own errors,  [perhaps?]  there would be juster [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
               
                judgment &amp; greater improvement in individuals. 
                When he speaks plainly I prefer to understand 
                him plainly, for I find it the most fruitful 
                of good. It has not been a personal feeling 
                for particular persons — for Mr. Alcott for instance, 
                but this general principle, which would make
                me feel the same if a person I never knew
               
               
               
               
                were analysed &amp; decided upon. I know 
                that GOD only can know a person truly, 
                from my own experience, &amp; I know that immense 
                mistakes are made in sweeping or even in what
                seem cool, rational judgments of others. 
                But as the seeing mind cannot but observe 
                I have thought that each person had better 
                not by talking
                emphasize bad opinions of men —[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]  arguing 
                pronouncing &amp; deciding upon their motives &amp; actions, 
                which ever must be somewhat in the dark —
                but let the opinion be constantly modified
                or changed in the mind by the evolving of circumstances &amp; 
                the influx of more light. Then no one would 
                be so cruelly wronged as some are — &amp; there 
                would be more time &amp; room for the interchange 
                of thought about things which are eternal —
                Christ might say <q>Woe unto you, hypocrites!</q> because 
                there was no mote in his eye to take out,<a id="pmote" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nmote" class="annotation" title="See Matt. 7: 3-5."><sup>1</sup></a> &amp; he 
                could see with clear vision, what was in 
                man, but it is not so with the less exalted. 
                I have said to myself Oh let me enjoy &amp; speak 
                of the good I see — &amp; be silent of the evil I see. 
               You  &amp; Mary have thought me morbid about 
                hearing certain people spoken of — I always knew
                this was not the truth. It was not the person 
                but the thing that I struggled against. 
                Even when I have mutely listened, I have 
                always had a mental reservation that perhaps 
                it was not so — for GOD alone could see the heart —
                &amp; comprehend all the grounds upon which it 
                acted. I can see good in being openeyed
               &amp; not acting with a rash confidence — but I
                suspect I shall live forever &amp; not see good
               
               
               
               
               in dwelling upon personal faults. For my life
               I <U>cannot</U>
               percieve [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                the least use in talking
               about them. I never hear of a great crime
               committed that I do not wish I had a hundred
               thousand arms &amp; powers to guard the person
               from being utterly condemned, because no man
               can know the tragedy, the struggle, the woe,
               the misery of the being's inward life who
               transgressed—and it is an infinite comfort to me
               always to know that GOD knows all &amp; will accordingly
               award with infinite tenderness— &amp; allow for 
               want of light. A murder which horrifies the
               community never seems to me so dreadful or wrong
               in the eye of Heaven as the animadversions of
               those who think they are more righteous than the
               murderer. <U>Nevertheless</U>, I can certainly suppose
               that to you it may seem quite otherwise about
               this matter, &amp; that you do your duty in a way
               of proceeding, which with my idea—it would
               manifestly be wrong for me to adopt.
               I <U>never thought it want of charity</U> in you
               or Mary
               to 
               
               percieve [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
               
                failings—but that it did
               more harm than good to talk about them—
               because I know it is impossible for an intelligent
               mind <U>not</U> to take observations. But to[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] 
               it has been productive of more good to [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] 
                reflect as little as possible upon the shadow,
               
               
                &amp; live &amp; expand in the
               light &amp; I feel
               more love &amp; charity &amp; see more every day.
               GOD will give the increase to <U>both</U> our sowings
               
               since <U>both</U>
               are 
               sown in obedience
               to the conscience. I never considered myself
               better than you or Mary
               or whoever — but in
               some things I am very <U>different</U> in my habits
               of mind. I never compare myself wi[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] th others — I
               try to <U>be</U> as simply
               as possible without [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]  thinking
               how I am— &amp; I never feel how I am except when I
               
               
               
               
               fall short as I often do of the mark. I am conscious
               of it &amp; feel remorse. It is only in remorse that 
               I feel myself — when I am unjust to others — or 
               impatient — then I am smitten as with a rod — &amp; 
               feel how much better others are then I — but the 
               contrary never occupies my thoughts. 
               If I have verged to either extreme it has been that
               every body was better then I, <span style="font-style:italic">ceteris paribus.</span>
               Do not suppose I extend this to fault finding face 
               to face. I think this is good &amp; productive of great
               benefit — for then the two persons being all that 
               are concerned in the matter can take care of
               themselves, &amp; be improved by each other's lights. 
                But to talk &amp; judge of a person 
               who is not present to have his or her dictum
               may cause great harm &amp; wrong. But do not
               
               
               
               
               
               ever take for granted by inference a harsh judgment. Now both
               you &amp; Mary have taken up this idea of my view of Mrs. Alcott
               because I had said she was violent &amp; said tremendous things to
               her husband. But you should have stopped at my words — &amp; then you
               would
               have been 
               more just —
               I never
               said I 
               did not 
               respect 
               &amp; love her —
               nor implied 
               it intentionally — I 
               think we 
               always 
               come 
               nearest 
               right when 
               we infer 
               the best 
               instead 
               of the 
               worst 
               thing —
               I wish 
               you would 
               not think 
               you know 
               what I 
               never express.
               As to 
               Beauty 
               I would
               
               
               
               
               never sacrifice one iota of goodness or truth to it as you might suppose —
               but Christ was ever beautiful — &amp; my aim is to do so, as well as true &amp;
               good — for I think Beauty is the result of the two. But I never was
               
               
               
               
                aware of seeking beauty in the first place. By keeping my heart
                right, which [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                is goodness, I hope to see truth, &amp; then Beauty
                will flow. This is my order — not the contrary. I have scarcely
                taken the first step; but I feel that this is
                the way to go. 
               You say it is not my tas[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]  <U>think</U> of Mr. Alcott's
               failings — this I did not say
               but it is my taste [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] 
               <U> talk of any body's</U> failings. Don't you see why I do not
               like to say anything. You misunderstand me
               
               
               
               
                almost always — or give it with 
                your mind a little different
               aspect. That saying you repeat about the 
               imagination is not  just as I meant it
                but no matter. I hate
               to explain.

                for she had a raging headache 
                 &amp; has been on the bed &amp; dizzy.
                When she finished yr letter she 
               burst into tears. I told her I 
                hoped that would give her
                pleasure — she said it did,
                but she could not help crying —
                &amp; that you did not understand
                her about Mrs. Alcott

                she has said to you here) I told

                but I did not persist in
                talking, for she said she felt
                as if her body was just where 
                it was seven months ago tho'
                her mind was in a different
                state. Now don't tell her I 
                told you this about her body, for*
               
               
               
               
                *if you wish to have her tranquil, you must let her alone 
                now. I believe if you &amp; she have any more cryings 
                about each other I shall die. I have often wished you 1st page

                till I think this matter is not to be
                alluded to again. I hope you will not
                say Alcott for one year if you can help
                it, for the word is the touchstone to
                all this emotion. There is no temper
                in her crying now if there ever was—it
                is pure physical agony — but she only apprehends now
                that it will be perhaps difficult to appear
                natural, at least for a time &amp; that you
                will misconstrue that—I have assured
                her that you will allow for that, and now

               With palimsestic postcript by "M" (Sophia Hawthorne's sister, Mary). Because of the
               complexity of cross-writing and marginal continuations that sometimes spread across
               different pages
               of the bifolium, the "By MS Page" and "Facsimile/Text" views of this edition
               organize the letter by sections rather than pages, "sections" defined as blocks of
               text oriented 
               similarly on the page. To help readers envision the complex layout of
               the text, we provide the following diagrams of the front and back of the bifolium:

            <br>My dear Lizzie,
            
            
            <p>
               I suppose that Mr Taylor
               has
               told you of George's perfect frame
               of mind — of his experience of
               that divine glow which was so
               unaccountable — but so sweet &amp;
               refreshing to him — &amp; seemed so like
               an intimation from GOD that
               it was well with him —; but he
               would not tell you how like
               a tender &amp; strong angel he  ^
                himself  was
               to us all — what a wonderful
               prayer he offered — which seemed
               to bring the host of heaven
               down to watch &amp; duly ward -
               which brought heaven into
               George's chamber &amp; carried us
               all as on Dove's wings into
               the spiritual world.  It was the
               most fervid — the most affectionate,
               tender &amp; divine uplifting of 
               soul to the infinite Father —
               that I ever heard.  He prayed for 
               each — for the <q>Mother, the tender
                  Mother — who hung around her life</q>
               for the Father's manly heart —
               for the sister whose duty called
               her away — <q> &amp; oh —  bless <U>our dear Mary</U></q>
               
               
               
               
               he said — <q>let not that peaceful
                  stream be disturbed — </q> he prayed
               for the sister present — 'she with
               the delicate nerves —' For Aunt
               Pickman too he petitioned
               Heaven —     The tears were at
               last loosened from my brain
               which I had kept back so long
               that I began to feel as if they
               were accumulating there —
               &amp; they flowed down my face
               like a summer rain without
               convulsion.  After he rose
               from his knees, George stretched 
               out his arms &amp; Mr Taylor
               clasped him to his heart in
               a long, long embrace — Every
               moment ejaculating "The Lord
               bless you!  Bless you!  Bless you!"
               in such a thrilling tone that
               it seemed as if blessings must
               come in legions at the call —
               
               George's thin white hands were
               
               
               
               
               so firmly fastened round his neck
               that I thought he would never
               let the Angel go — even after he
               had blessed him — but at last
               he relaxed his hold. Then  Mr
               Taylor turned to me &amp; took both
               hands. <q>Be strong</q> said he. <q>
                  <U>It is</U>
                  <U>very pleasant on the other side</U>—Be
                  quiet like a May morning.</q>
               He came with me into my room.
               
               <q>Oh George is a perfect lamb! A
                  perfect lamb. He is moonlight —
                  so clear — mild — I would not but
                  have seen him for the world. It
                  was worth coming just to look at
                  him. He never looked so handsome
                  in his life. There is no distortion
                  there. All is right. All is right.</q>
               I cannot tell you all he said now.
               Oh he is the most helpful — the
               divinest spirit — is he not?
               
               George said there could not be such
               a prayer conceived of. <q>Mr. Taylor
                  is no sham</q> — he said.
               
               George is very much revived this
               afternoon. He had not a bad
               chill this morning — hardly any — &amp;
               yesterday it was
               two hours long 
               
               
               
               
               
               Mary came today &amp; staid two hours
               I carried her your letter this afternoon
               &amp; she had recieved [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                no harm.
               
               George thinks it would not be
               right for you to come on
               Wednesday. He thinks of
               every thing in all relations
               with exactest precision.
               Yesterday he wandered a
               little several times, &amp; this
               afternoon while I was rubbing
               his arm, he was saying
               something — &amp; then said something
               I did not hear. <q>What did
                  you say</q> I asked. <q>It 
                  was nothing to the purpose, he
                  replied. <U>I was wandering</U>.</q>
               I never saw such clearness. He
               looks from some high place
               even upon his aberrations.
               I can write no more now
               I recieved [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                a blessed refreshment
               yesterday P.M. beside  Mr
               Taylor, a long — closely written letter
               </p>

            <br>My dear Elizabeth,
             
            
            <p> I am really
               too tired to write a letter,
               but cannot bear to let a
               chance slip. Una has
               
               written a sad letter which
               I fear will make your
               heart ache. I am glad
               to say that the Roman
               fever seems to have been
               arrested in her — for she
               has had no chills for two
               days. She is a lily now,
               her lifelong roses snatched
               away, but during these
               two days I have thought
               to see a dawn of roses
               in her cheeks and lips,
               though she is now suffering
               from influenza.
               
               </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Ada's fever is past. She
               is well of that today, but has
               a very painful shoulder —
               and lies in bed still.
               
               
               
               
                I have had no moment to 
                write to you in all these 
                weeks — having been ill 
                myself in the interval 
                of nursing others.  No Rome 
                this winter for us so far. 
                My journal is left in the 
                middle of a sentence, which 
                can never be recalled 
                now,  and I am 
                sorry, because I had an 
                idea of the Faun at that
               moment. 
               </p>

                Perhaps we shall have 
                February and March 
                for a little enjoyment 
                of Rome, and half of April. 
                Then we leave it for aye 
                and go to Venice and thence 
                to the cities in the north 
                of Italy &amp; to Geneva and 
                Paris.

               Mrs. Ward is here and I 
                have not had a moment 
                to go and see her.  But I had 
                a long note from her. She
               
               
               
               
                is very happy and content in her 
                sunny sky-parlor in the Hotel 
                d'Angliterre — <q>with no cares, no 
                   anxieties, only hopes</q> she says. 
                She suffered terribly from the 
                severe treatment of Dr Simpson
                but expects to feel benefit 
                next summer from it. 
                Neither have I been able to see 
                once Mrs Browning, and 
                only once Mr Browning who 
                has been three times to see 
                us.  Mrs Browning does not 
                make visits. Mary Motley
                I see here sometimes.  I 
                have read the Dutch Republic<a id="pdutch" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#ndutch" class="annotation" title="Note about The Dutch Republic.."><sup>4</sup></a>
                during my watches, and the 
                book is superb, I think. 
                Miss Cushman has been here, 
                but I could not see her. 
                Mr. Hawthorne saw her. 
                No society for me this winter. 
                Rosebud is exquisitely good 
                generous and considerate in 
                these times, but I can give 
                you no Altar of Roses now. 
                Mr. Hawthorne is quite 
                well.  Here is cause for 
                great joy — for last winter he 
               
               
               
               
                had the Grippe three months. 
                Julian also is well with 
                only slight nose cold. 
                Rose has today gone to 
                the Palazzo Galitzin<a id="pgalitzin" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#ngalitzin" class="annotation" title="A fashionable district in the 19th century located in the center of Rome, just off the Tiber in Via della Scrofia #117 ROM 208-209."><sup>5</sup></a> to see 
               the Westons, who delight in 
                her.  She draws with a 
                wonderful expression. 
                Julian copies Flaxman
                <span style="font-style:italic">à merveille</span>.

            <p>
                I long to answer all 
                your letters one by one — 
                and I long to tell you much. 
                I have sent some letters 
                of Una to you and Mary 
                lately.  I never got 
                yours and Mary's letters 
                directed to Florence.  Though 
                Mr Browning has written 
                about them to the Post Office 
                they do not come.  I have 
                lost all your account of dear 
                Dr. Wesselhoeft. I endure 
                astonishingly through all 
                things.  Goodbye with 
                thousand blessings.

            <br>Sunday
            <br>My dear Elizabeth— I have
            
            
            <p>
                become so occupied with 
                the unhappy Weiss, that 
                with my necessary household 
                cares, mending &amp; making —
                I have not had one 
                moment to answer your 
                note. It is Sunday and 
                all the children are at 
                Church, and I have a 
                few moments of my own —
                and out of a hundred 
                things I want to do, I 
                take some time for you. 
                We could not take 
                advantage of the free
                lessons of Dr. Kinner
                for Una, on account
                partly of the expense 
                of railroad fare — while 
                there were other reasons 
               less imperative. I 
               am very sorry, but
               
               
               
               
                since there is not 
                literally money enough 
                for it — I accept the 
                disappointment. For it 
                is certainly a very plain 
                duty not to spend other
                peoples' money for 
                accomplishments — or any thing else. And as 
                we are very closely pressed 
                this year — and feel it 
                important not to grind 
                Julian too closely in
                college, (though he must 
                be exceedingly economical 
                at the best) — we must 
                all sacrifice a great 
                many pleasant things.

                sent for Una and Julian
                to go to see them this 
                winter. But for the 
                same reason, they cannot 
                go. It would cost at 
                least thirty dollars for 
                travel from our 
               door to theirs, and 
                Julian would have to 
                have a new suit of 
                clothes — costing thirty
               more — before he could
               go. As to me, I am 
                going without any 
                thing new whatever 
                and I only wish I could 
                give up any thing more	
                so as to gratify
                them. As to their father

                without things. He will

               Julian has had expensive 
                books stolen by some 
                theives [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                among the 
                Sophomores — one very 
               immense Greek Lexicon, 
                what I should think

                when they think he

                you so much, you will
                say I am making a 
                fine story and praising
                him too much. It is a 
                pity I cannot talk to
                a sister without that
                suspicion — is n't it?
               
               
               
               
                When I do not answer 
                your notes, dear Elizabeth 
                sometimes, it is not
                because I accept
                them, but because I
                disagree, and think it
                of no use to discuss
                the matter. Some things
                in that long ago note
                I agreed with, however —
                Rose's face expresses too
                much critical displeasure
                I very well see often.
                She is in precisely the
                mood that Una was
                in at her age in Rock
                Ferry. Una was then
                disgusted with every body 
                and thing that did not 
                suit her taste &amp; principles
                and seemed to fail
                utterly in St Paul's 
                Charity. I was quite
               
               
               
               
                alarmed, until a certain 
                Mrs. Allbut told me
                that I need not fear
                at all, for that when
                Una was eighteen she
                would be all right, and
                that this fastidiousness
                at her age was the
                most hopeful of all
                states. I find it true.
                Una is always excusing
                every body now, and 
                finding good points
                in every one, and no
                soul is more full of
                generous, self sacrificing
                love. Every person I
                know in Concord
                bursts out to me about
                her in enthusiastic
                praise — not moderate 
                but enthusiastic praise.
                You get all your evil
                impressons [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                of her
               
               
               
               
                from the Alcotts probably,
                as no one else maligns 
                her. Mrs Emerson, all

                Pritchards, the MacKays,
                the Hoars, the all
                the world of Concord
                agree in love to her.
                They call her <q>loveliest</q>
                <q>the most devoted</q> <q>the
                   most generous</q> and
                all sorts of pretty names.
                Miss Rose deserves your
                censure, but as she
                has a world of adoring
                love in her, I hope she
                will  [soon?] love all 
                her fellow creatures
                as she now loves
                some of them. I
                talk with her a great
                deal about the propriety 
                of feeling genial and 
                pleased in society —
                and I shall continue to
               
               
               
               3<sup>d</sup>
                adjure her. But
                I do not doubt she 
                will be a loving and 
                gracious person. For
                you do not know what 
                a power of generosity 
                she has — and all in
                the true Christ-spirit 
                of not letting the right 
                hand know &amp;c. For 
                this is one thing they
                were born with or 
                I have brought out —
                to make no show of 
                any thing they can 
                do or feel . . . They are 
                genuine — and all 
                as true as heaven itself. 
                Oh dear — now I am 
                off on this eulogistic 
                track. But really if 
                you lived with them 
                you would not love 
                them little. And if 
                you could see how  Julian's
               
               
               
               
                innocence is becoming 
                virtue, you would be 
                glad as I am; and
                overflow sometimes. 
                Religious principle is 
                the only sure guard
                angelic, and I am sure 
                they all have it. They 
                are all reverent. 
                I think a cultivated 
                imagination and a 
                delicate — or unsmothered
                conscience are the diamond 
                shield against evil. 
                Julian's memory scintillates 
                with high, heroic thoughts 
                and deeds. His father 
                put into him, reading 
                aloud, every noble story 
                of literature. He has 
                therefore kept the 
                highest society — and 
                has no love for
               
               
               
               
                low persons — no
                tastes that are ignoble. 
                But I will stop this 
                talk — whether or no. 
                Who told the Queen of 
                the Angels<a id="pangels" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nangels" class="annotation" title="Presumably Sophia's sister, Mary Tyler Peabody Mann."><sup>8</sup></a> that I 
                complained about the 
                injury of the books? I 
                did not — and I never 
                asked any one to tell 
                her — I never thought it 
                owing to her carelessness —
                for I know she is 
                never careless. But 
                all the fly leaves were 
                torn out up to the
                very commencement 
                of the text in very 
                many. It seemed as 
                if they were torn out 
                for waste paper. 
                Somebody did it — but

                She will not be so
                angry therefore with
                me — who sent her no
                reproach nor message
                and would have
                forbidden anyone to
                say a word to her —
                she will not punish
                me, so innocent, by
                never borrowing
                another book from me!
                And she too, the Queen
                of the Angels! Tell
                her then to lay off her

                The reason I do not
                fancy Mrs Pugh is because
                she disenchanted herself
                by her artificialness and
                an effect of unveritable
               ness. At first I went
                upon your impression
                of her, and your talk of
                her to me. But very
                soon she became
                 [oppressive?]  and sultry
                and not genuine to
                me. And I declare I
                cannot help this.
                It is her fault, not
                mine. No reasoning
                no developments of
                her life will help it.
                Every person must stand
                or fall upon their character
                as evidenced by their
                presences.  It is a
                law of the universe
                and no talk will alter it.
               
               
               
                I take a fancy to
                Mr. &amp; Mrs. Turner, of
                whom you speak very
                 [Sneeringly?]  because they
                are single, simple, true,
                lovely and refined —
                These are very good
                reasons, and very good
                qualities.

                I have had to 
                neglect many things —
                not however so imperative
               
               
               
                as their needs.</p>
            <p>
                I have the comfort of
                a perfect peace and
                order &amp; intelligence
                in the kitchen — for
                which I am most
                thankful — for I
                dreaded Ann's going
                to California— away
                from me. There are
                other treasures, I
                find among the
                Irish besides her.
                Indeed I knew this
                but feared not to
                become possessed
                of them.
               </p>
            
            <p>
                I hope you are very
                well and that the
                Queen of the Angels
                is well this autumn.
               
               
               
               
                Give my love to
                her.

            <p>
                Oh Elisabeth, your letter of Nov 12 came 
                yesterday noon, after immense longing 
                on my part to hear from you about 
                Horace particularly, and now alas the
               beloved child has passed into the
               heavens. From the delay of the letter,
               I had great fears that either Horace
               or Mary were very ill, and that you
               waited to give me good news. I am 
               deeply grieved, and notwithstanding 
               your precaution in preparing the
               way to tell me finally that he was
               "still forever." I was smitten to the
               heart when I came to that; for I 
               began to think you told me the details 
               of his illness as the "sad news" and that 
               he lived yet here below. Fortunately
               the blow made me burst into tears 
               and sobs, (a very rare thing for me now)
               so that the acute pang did not hurt me
               so much. But I am in the greatest
               anxiety about Mary. The world has 
               lost a rare person. Where will you find 
               such fidelity, such devotion, such earnestness, 
               such perseverance, such solemn 
               dedication of the talents God has given.
               I loved him greatly, and my respect 
               for his life was profound. I mourn
               for my dear Horace with deepest 
               sorrow. I did hope to persuade him 
               to come to us in Dresden for recreation, 
               change and observation of the gains 
               of science here. He was so large in
               his scope. When I asked him once
               which branch of science he <U>preferred</U>
               
               
               
               
               he looked at me with surprise and replied
               "How can I like one branch of science better
               than another?" True enough — how can 
               anyone — and yet, how few have this 
               broad love, and how many keep in 
               one groove. His was indeed the genuine 
               love for the widest knowledge. His 
               magnificent purposes and hopes 
               probably needed another sphere to 
               be fulfilled, for oh Elisabeth, I
               <U>never</U>
               believed that Horace would live to 
               the prime of manhood in this world. 
               <U>I was sure</U> he would die young, and 
               so I am not surprised, however much 
               I grieve. He had not robustness of 
               constitution enough to bear such  [constant?] 
                and profound study. He told me once 
                he was never for one moment rested,
                and never expected to be! He worked 
                with pure spirit always, and not 
                with physical power. Even his 
                enormous walks and climbings 
                and reachings in America and 
                the Sandwich Islands<a id="psandwich" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nsandwich" class="annotation" title="The Hawaiian Islands.."><sup>11</sup></a> and everywhere, 
                were accomplished because his 
                will and wish were so omnipotent—
                not because he had bodily force 
                enough. It was sublime and 
                beautiful to a degree hardly
                surpassed. I feel honored that I 
                was related to him. I think there
                never was a purer sacrifice offered 
                to disinterested science. He was a 
                martyr without stain. When I saw 
                him first with the seal of death on his
               
               
               
               
                brow (as I <U>knew.</U>) it was astonishing to 
                observe the fine beauty of his face—
                the intellectual dignity suddenly
               increased so much. Julian remarked 
               yesterday that when he bade him 
               goodbye on the eve before we left Boston 
               that he had never seen him look 
               so well—(meaning so fine in expression) 
               Ah it is we only who are disappointed! 
               and lamenting— For just think of him 
               now with no obstruction between him 
               and the universe of God. Think how 
               his face shines with eternal joy as 
               he apprehends the secrets of creation. 
               If he had had a stronger body and 
               tougher health, he would doubtless 
               have lost in delicacy of perception 
               and acute sensibility to all the
               mysterious laws and results of Nature. 
               Also in living here among less
               exalted persons in his vocation he might have 
               finally merged  spirit in the matter 
               that is  also so wonderful and fine. 
               He was too susceptible of suffering for 
               those who loved him vitally, to really 
               enjoy his progress. I was always in
               terror of the sudden breaking down 
               of overtaxed brain and nerves.
               I thank God he did not lose his 
               reason under the pressure of his cares. 
               Oh how much better that he should 
               enter into endless Rest than to 
               merely exist here  without use of reason. 
               That would surely have broken our hearts.
               
               
               
               
                But he entered the mansion prepared 
                for him in his Heavenly Father's House, living
                and conscious through all his being. 
                Were not the words he first heard 
               <q>Well done, Thou 
                  good and faithful servant. Thou hast 
                   been faithful over a few things. I will 
                   make thee ruler over many things!
                   Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</q><a id="pjoy" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#njoy" class="annotation" title="Matt. 25:21."><sup>12</sup></a>
                For has not he gained five talents 
                more than the five which the Lord 
                delivered unto him? Did he ever 
                fold one in a napkin? When his 
                mother's first agony of separation is 
                over, his noble life will come back 
                to her like an angel of consolation —; 
                and she will feel rewarded in a 
                celestial way for her truly divine 
                care and sympathy with him. One in 
                a thousand mothers is she, and it 
                would indeed be a pity to part such 
                love. <U>It is not parted</U>— oh no —; His 
                gratitude on earth to her could never
                reach his gratitude to her in heaven 
                where he can better appreciate and 
                understand her single devotion to 
                his highest good. And his father is 
                there to receive and welcome him 
                without a misgiving! For did not he 
                rise to his father's most ardent 
                prayers for him? I am comforting 
                myself — How I wish I could comfort 
                Mary. God alone can speak to her— 
                I do not know what it is to lose a son. 
                God bless and help her, as He surely will.
               
               
               
               
                Her remarkable fortitude will aid her 
                now, and also her generous tenderness. 
                I hope she will live for the others. 
                She said once she wished to live till 
                Ben was 21. I hope she will not 
                be drawn up into the blessed land 
                after Horace, and I think she will
                stay for the rest. She has such 
                identity of life with her children, 
                that I cannot conceive of their doing 
                without her on earth. If Horace could 
                miss any thing in a state, the felicity 
                of which eye hath not seen nor 
                ear heard, it would be his mother's 
                embracing care. But he has that 
                still, and all else superadded, and
                as I first exclaimed with sobs 
                and tears <q>He never will be tired any 
                   more!</q> Human power could never
                compass what he meant to do, and 
                not to disappoint him, His Heavenly 
                Father took him from earthly 
                obstacles and constant suffering, 
                where he can never more be <U>cold</U> 
                nor weary nor interrupted in his 
                immortal course of knowledge 
                and aspiration. Two witnesses 
                have George and Ben now 
                in heaven — Two angels to watch and 
                ward. I trust you have written 
                again to tell me how they do and 
                how they bear it. But of Mary 
                I am most fearful, because she 
                is frail, and had lately been so ill.
               
               
               
               
                She has such strength of endurance that 
                I believe she will live here as long 
                as she desires to live, because also 
                her wish to live is so unselfish. 
                She wishes to live for her children 
                and not for herself. Perhaps by and
               
                by I can write to her, but how could 
                I speak to her now. I am dumb
                before her in this terrible moment.</p>
            
            
            <p>
                I think with satisfaction of what
                is very trifling to others—but not to 
                me. It is that Horace was always
                very affectionate and sweet to me 
                I remember his grasp of hand 
                and his smile whenever I met 
                him — and whenever he said <q>Aunt
                   Sophia</q> — I was always moved, each 
                time, as if he first said it then. 
                I also remember well what a respect 
                and regard my husband had for 
                him. He always liked to talk 
                with him and to hear everything 
                he said. His sincerity, seriousness
                of purpose and varied knowledge 
                and intelligence made him 
                so attractive to Mr. Hawthorne— 
                and in his presence there was such 
                a modest dignity of manners— 
                so thoughtful an air of 
                conscientious consideration as 
                was truly beautiful.
               
               
               
               
                I believe the last time I saw him 
                in Concord was when he came in
                loaded with lovely arethusas — and 
                presented me with a radiant 
                sheaf of them. I was always thankful 
                to see him come — but how seldom 
                he came. I felt he could not waste 
                his time, for seldom anyone so 
                impressed me with the value of 
                moments. He never wasted any
                time! What a marvel! Not since 
                childhood, when he began to try 
                chemic experiments. How thoroughly 
                he obeyed the command<q>Work while 
                   it is day —</q></p>
            
            
            <p>
                When he came home from the 
                Sandwich Islands, there was a knot of 
                pain on his brow, which did not wear 
                quite away till I saw the seal of
                death take its place. I always 
                wondered what had troubled him. 
                Perhaps he has now told his mother — 
                but I am sure he had some great 
                trouble which he thought best to 
                keep to himself. I sometimes 
                thought I would ask him to tell 
                me, as he might be reluctant to 
                disturb his mother — for I thought 
                he would feel better to relieve 
                himself of it, whatever he was. 
                It is no matter now —; for when
                the golden gate turned back on its
               
               
               
               
               [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] inges, and shut him in from
                the world, all cares were left
                outside, and his brow now [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] 
               is smooth
                with peace. I begin today to be
                conscious of his peace — I could think
                of only Mary's loss and [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] the loss of
                us all at first. Today I have written
                myself into an ecstasy with his gain
                and relief and I wish I could know
                soon about Mary. No doubt a letter
                is on its way to me now. This one
                of yours may have been at Thode's
                a few days. Do not send any more
                to the Bankers. 46 <U>B</U>
               <span style="font-style:italic">Bautzner
                   Strasse</span> is my address. The Postman
                is a nice man, and every thing is safe
                with him. I suppose the Bankers
                cannot send letters about. </p>

                I do not incline to write or think
                of any thing but Horace and Mary.
                You have received four letters from me
                before this time — the three last were
                announcements. I will write again
                We are all well, and happy to be here.
                I should like some money very much. I
                was to have some from Ticknor &amp; Fields
                in November for the former books<a id="pnotebooks" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nnotebooks" class="annotation" title="Nathaniel Hawthorne's American Notebooks, published by Ticknor and Fields, that Sophia felt she was not being properly compensated for.

                the firm is dissolved. If so, perhaps I
                am without redress. I wish Mr Hillard
                could send my January dividend so I
                can have it by 1st January. What he
                is <U>sure</U> of he can advance me perhaps.
                All send love and deep sympathy. We are at Sophia H.<a id="pSophiaH" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nSophiaH" class="annotation" title="&#34;Sophia H.&#34; is written in pencil in the margin by an unknown hand."><sup>14</sup></a>

            About this View of the Journal
            </h2>
         <hr>
         <p><a id="view"></a> This presentation of the Hawthorne letters derives from the project's 
            main XML file, hawthorne_letters.xml, transformed with hawthorne_view_common.xsl and
            hawthorne_view_reading.xsl.
            In this "view" of the Hawthorne letters, line breaks in the
            manuscripts are not reported; rather, lines wrap in the browser's window. Similarly,
            page
            breaks are not reported. Paragraph breaks follow those in the manuscript. Spelling,
            punctuation, capitalization, and abbreviations are reported as they appear in the
            manuscript. Text highlighted by the correspondents with an underscore is underscored
            in this
            view. Canceled text is suppressed. Text added between lines or in the margins is silently
            incorporated into the reading text. Uncertain readings are enclosed in square brackets
            and followed by a
            question mark, and text supplied by the editor for clarity is set in italics and surrounded
            by square brackets. Links to notes and external materials are superscripted and colored.
