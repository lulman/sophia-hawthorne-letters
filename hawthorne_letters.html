         <div class="fl_img_right"><img src="image_my_dear_elizabeth_1863.jpg" alt="&#xA;&#x9;                       My Dear Lizzie&#xA;&#x9;                     "><br>Salutation [1863]</div>	                 
         
         <p>The Peabody sisters—Elizabeth (1804–1894), Mary (1806–1887), and Sophia
            (1809–1871)—were by any measure extraordinary. Elizabeth became a trailblazing
            educational reformer who founded schools for women and for young children and wrote
            prolifically throughout her life, publishing articles and books about education and
            American culture. Mary partnered on several educational projects and co-authored a
            book on education with Elizabeth, published a novel, and wrote a biography of her
            late husband, Horace Mann, among many other works. Sophia was an accomplished
            copyist/artist/illustrator and, after the death of her husband, novelist Nathaniel
            Hawthorne, the editor of editions of his notebooks and her own journals. The
            contributions of all three women individually to the social and intellectual life
            of
            American letters have been examined in many books and articles, including two
            biographies of Elizabeth (Baylor; Ronda), a joint biography of Horace Mann and Mary
            Peabody (Tharp), and a two-volume biography of Sophia (Valenti). Moreover, their
            combined role in nineteenth-century American culture has been the subject of two
            group biographies (Tharp; Marshall) and a collection of essays (Elbert, et al.).
            </p>
         
         <p>The group biographies reflect not only the cumulative contributions of the Peabody
            sisters but also the fact that their lives were close-knit. Sophia and Mary taught
            in schools founded by Elizabeth. The sisters lived together at various times during
            their adult lives—Elizabeth and Mary frequently during early adulthood, Mary and
            Sophia during an eighteen-month-long stay in Cuba 1833–1835, where Sophia was
            recovering from a prolonged illness and Mary provided support for her sister while
            working as a governess, a position arranged for her by Elizabeth. The sisters aided
            one another’s professional endeavors, in part by introducing one another to their
            personal and professional circles. As siblings do everywhere, they fought, sometimes
            bitterly. And, in an era before telephones or email, they corresponded regularly and
            voluminously about matters public and private. Many of the sisters’ letters and
            papers are preserved in archives—over 1,900 of Sophia’s letters have been catalogued
            (Valenti, email July 30; see the list of archives below). That abundance of
            material, and the long and complexly intertwined lives and accomplishments of the
            Peabody sisters, presents a challenge to any account of the sisters’ work, much less
            this edition of a small archive of five letters written by Sophia to Elizabeth over
            a period of three decades. As Megan Marshall recounts regarding her biography of the
            Peabody sisters, <br><div class="blockquote">I had discovered early on that, even if I’d wanted
               to write about only one sister, I couldn’t have done a good job of it without
               reading everything written by all three. Their letters intertwined, so that
               reading only Sophia’s side of a correspondence, for example, would give only a
               partial view. (Marshall, "Epilogue" 249)<br><br></div>With that caveat in mind, this brief
            introduction can nevertheless provide some context for the letters in this edition
            and note their predominant themes in the hope that, for readers new to Sophia
            Hawthorne’s story, the letters can serve as a jumping-off point, and, for scholars
            familiar with the Peabody sisters, provide new insights. For the most part, these
            are personal letters focused on family matters: expressing a personal grievance,
            sharing news of a loved one’s final illness, recounting family life abroad,
            defending children against criticism, and expressing grief and consoling memories
            upon the death of a nephew.</p>
         
         <h3 id="">1837: "You misunderstand me almost always"</h3>
         
         <p> Sophia Peabody wrote the first letter in this collection in the late summer of
            1837, at a time when she and her sisters were living with their parents in Salem,
            Massachusetts. Sophia, then aged 27, had returned to live with her parents in 1835
            after her rest cure in Cuba. She had suffered from ill health—including severe
            migraines—since childhood, probably caused in part by mercury poisoning resulting
            from a common treatment for toothing pain in children. She was also addicted to
            opium prescribed for pain relief. Her time in Cuba did not provide lasting relief:
            in an 1835 letter to Elizabeth, Sophia described herself as “a bed case—a poor,
            miserable, maimed—nerve twisted—trembling, warmed concern” (qtd. in Marshall, <cite>The
               Peabody Sisters</cite> 354). Mary, aged 30 in August of 1837, had established a school for
            young children in Salem and begun assisting her future husband, Horace Mann, with
            his duties as secretary to the Massachusetts board of education. Elizabeth, aged 33,
            had two years earlier published <cite>Record of a School</cite> (1835), based on transcripts of
            Bronson Alcott’s dialogues with students at his Temple School, where Elizabeth and,
            for a shorter period, Mary served as Alcott’s assistants (Marshall, The Peabody
            Sisters 314). However, by the spring of 1837, the Temple School was “all but
            dissolved” (Marshall 326). </p>
         
         <p>A dispute over what Sophia takes to be her sisters’ misunderstanding of her
            “estimation of Mrs. Alcott” is the subject of Sophia’s letter of August 8, 1837—and
            the note apparently added to the letter by Mary. The Peabody sisters had known the
            Alcotts since 1830 (Marshall, The Peabody Sisters 294), but the sisters’
            relationship with the Abbot’s—especially with Bronson Alcott’s wife, Abby—had been
            strained in recent years in part by disagreements over the Temple School and an
            incident in which Abby Alcott read some of Elizabeth’s letters in which she was
            critical of Alcott, and Sophia took the Alcotts’ side in the dispute (Marshall, The
            Peabody Sisters 320, 324). Here, however, Sophia complains about Elizabeth’s (and
            Mary’s) interpretation of a comment she had made about Mrs. Alcott: <br><div class="blockquote">. . . you &amp;
               Mary have taken up this idea of my view of Mrs. Alcott because I had said she was
               violent &amp; said tremendous things to her husband. But you should have stopped at my
               words — &amp; then you would have been more just — I never said I did not respect &amp; love
               her — nor implied it intentionally — I think we always come nearest right when we
               infer the best instead of the worst thing — I wish you would not think you know what
               I never express.<br><br></div> Sophia argues, in effect, that Elizabeth and Mary have taken
            description of Mrs. Alcott’s behavior as fault-finding behind someone’s back,
            something that Sophia maintains is not in her nature. She offers an extended
            explanation of her principled objection to “discussing of people's faults,”
            grounding her position in Matthew 7:3–5 from Christ’s Sermon on the Mount. In
            addition, she objects to what she takes to be her sisters’ unjustified
            interpretation of her “estimation” of Mrs. Alcott’s character based on her
            description of Mrs. Alcott’s behavior. </p>
         
         <p>As we shall see, assessments of character figure repeatedly in this small
            collection of letters, but in this situation, Mary (assuming it was she who added
            the note to Sophia’s letter signed “M”) is concerned not with settling the dispute
            but avoiding it for the sake of Sophia’s health and her own peace of mind. Of
            Sophia’s reaction to Elizabeth’s letter, Mary writes, 
            ". . . she had
            a raging headache &amp; has been on the bed &amp; dizzy. . . . she said she felt
            as if her body was just where it was seven months ago."
             And of her own reaction
            to the tension, Mary—who, we should recall, spent two years helping Sophia attempt
            to regain health in Cuba—sounds at wit’s end: 
            "I believe if you &amp;
            she have any more cryings about each other I shall die. I have often wished you
            both dead, &amp; I shall never enjoy you till I think this matter is not to be
            alluded to again."
            
            </p>
         	             
         <h3 id="">1839: "He prayed for each"</h3>
         
         <p>The next letter in the collection was written over two years later, in November
            1839, as Sophia’s brother George lay dying of spinal tuberculosis at their parents’
            home in Salem. Another brother, Wellington, had died in the autumn of 1837 while
            working at a hospital in New Orleans during a yellow fever outbreak (Marshall, The
            Peabody Sisters 349–350). At the time, George had also been living in New Orleans
            in
            the hope that a warmer climate would ease his long-standing ill health (Marshall
            331). George returned to Salem in January 1838, he and Sophia both living as
            invalids in their parents’ home (Marshall, The Peabody Sisters 359), and by the fall
            all three Peabody sisters were living in Salem and supporting George (Marshall, The
            Peabody Sisters 369), then in January 1839 Mary moved to Boston to teach (Marshall,
            The Peabody Sisters 379). In mid-November, Sophia wrote to inform Elizabeth—who was
            in Boston attending one of Margaret Fuller’s Conversations—that George had suffered
            “a dangerous bleeding” (qtd. in Marshall, The Peabody Sisters 388). The letter in
            this collection, recounting a visit to George’s bedside by Rev. Edward Thompson
            Taylor, followed on November 19. Elizabeth rushed home, and George died in her care
            on November 25th.</p>
         
         <p>Sophia’s letter of 19 November recounts a deathbed watch, a process all too
            familiar at a time when people with terminal illnesses typically died at home,
            surrounded by family members, who often shared the details of a loved one’s final
            illness in letters (“Responses to Death”). Such letters might convey the dying
            person’s attitude toward death, exchanges of leave-taking with loved ones, and any
            “last words,” all of which appear in this letter, as well as an account of the
            intercession of Rev. Taylor.</p>
         	                 
         <h3 id="">1859: "Roman fever"</h3>
         
         <p>Twenty years pass between the previous letter in this collection and the next. In
            the early days of 1859, Sophia Hawthorne, now 49, is living in Rome with her husband
            of 18 years, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and their three children—Una (15), Julian (13),
            and Rose (8). The family has lived abroad since Nathaniel Hawthorne began serving
            as
            American consul in Liverpool, England (1853–1857), followed by travels on the
            Continent, including an extended stay in Rome during the winter and spring of
            1858–59. The Hawthornes returned to England in June of 1859 and to Concord,
            Massachusetts a year later.</p>
         
         <p>Elizabeth, now 54, publishes <cite>Universal History: Arranged to Illustrate Bem’s Charts</cite>
            in 1859 and is beginning to explore the kindergarten movement championed by German
            educator Friedrich Froebel, which will lead her to establish the first
            English-speaking kindergarten in America in 1861. Mary, 52, has been married to
            Horace Mann for fifteen years, with whom she has three children—Horace (14), George
            (13), and Benjamin (10). The Manns live in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where Horace Mann
            serves as president of Antioch College, and Mary mentors students and pursues
            writing projects, including <cite>Christianity in the Kitchen: A Physiological Cook-Book</cite>
            (1858) (ANB).</p>
         
         <p>This short letter dwells mostly on the scourge of infectious diseases, including “the
            Roman fever”—malaria. She recounts the toll on her family: Una is
            recovering from malaria but “is now suffering from influenza”; the children’s
            governess, Ada, has been gravely ill, probably with typhoid, but is recovering.
            Sophia has been “ill myself in the interval of nursing others.” Fortunately, Julian
            has only a “slight nose cold” and Nathaniel Hawthorne is “quite well,” though the
            previous winter he “had the Grippe [influenza] three months.” Illness keeps the
            Hawthornes from visiting with a circle of friends and acquaintances living in Rome,
            among them Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charlotte Saunders Cushman, Anna
            Hazard Barker Ward, Mary Motley, and Lucia Weston. In sum, as Sophia writes, “No
            society for me this winter.” However frustrating that isolation might have been for
            Sophia, more frustrating for readers of this edition is the missed opportunity to
            learn more about Sophia’s well-documented role in reviewing drafts of Nathaniel
            Hawthorne’s <cite>The Marble Faun</cite> (1860), on which Hawthorne began working during the
            family’s stay in Rome: Sophia writes, “My journal is left in the middle of a
            sentence, which can never be recalled now, and I am sorry, because I had an idea of
            the Faun at that moment” (see Valenti, “Sophia Hawthorne and ‘The—What?’”).</p>
         	           
         <h3 id="">1863: "I take some time for you"</h3>
         
         <p>Sophia Hawthorne wrote the next letter in this edition sometime in the autumn of
            1863 from Wayside, the family’s home in Concord, to which the Hawthornes had
            returned from England three years earlier. Widowed in August, 1859, Mary and her
            sons had also returned to live in Concord, where she continued writing. Elizabeth,
            while traveling often, kept a home in Boston and stayed with Mary during holidays
            (Woodson 283). She continued to run the kindergarten she founded in Boston in
            1861—near the end of this letter, Sophia apologizes for not having any “drawings for
            your babies this week” (presumably for Elizabeth’s students at the Pinkney Street
            school), one of the few reminders in these letters of Sophia’s artistic
            practice.</p>
         
         <p>Although Sophia’s letter makes no explicit mention of the Civil War, the war surely
            added to the burdens of “household cares, mending &amp; making” that have delayed
            her response to an earlier note from Elizabeth. Indeed, many of Sophia’s letters and
            journals from the war years discuss the conflict in detail (Hall, “Crisis”; Woodson,
            “With Hawthorne in Wartime Concord”) as well as describing the effects of the war
            on
            her expanded domestic chores, which she describes as including “farmer,”
            “house-builder,” and repairing damaged books (Hall, “Writing”)—perhaps the
            discussion in this letter about a misunderstanding occasioned by some damaged books
            relates to her book-binding. But in this letter, Sophia focuses on more immediately
            personal matters: financial strains, and her children’s characters.</p>
         
         <p>One sentence in particular presages problems that would soon intensify: “If Mr
            Hawthorne did not write, we could by no means make our expenses come within our
            income, and it is a pain to him to be so hard driven in his present unenergetic
            condition, and he doubts if we can at any rate easily make the ends meet.” Nathaniel
            Hawthorne died mere months later—in May 1864—and Sophia faced financial difficulties
            for the remainder of her life (Stewart, “Mrs. Hawthorne’s Financial
            Difficulties”).</p>
         
         <p>Much of the letter concerns the Hawthorne children, apparently responding to an
            earlier note from Elizabeth concerning their characters. These passages suggest a
            long-standing pattern in the sisters’ relationship. After recounting events related
            to Julian’s early days at Harvard University—where he matriculated in the fall of
            1863 but did not graduate, Sophia writes, “But if I tell you so much, you will say
            I
            am making a fine story and praising him too much. It is a pity I cannot talk to a
            sister without that suspicion — is n't it?” Sophia goes on to admit that Rose shows
            a character trait that Elizabeth had described in her previous note—“Some things in
            that long ago note I agreed with, however — Rose's face expresses too much critical
            displeasure.” Then she proceeds to extoll the children’s character until she seems
            to imagine Elizabeth’s reaction: “Oh dear — now I am off on this eulogistic track.
            But really if you lived with them you would not love them little. And if you could
            see how Julian's innocence is becoming virtue, you would be glad as I am; and
            overflow sometimes.” To be sure, Sophia’s disagreement with Elizabeth concerns her
            estimation of the Hawthorne children’s characters, not the importance of taking the
            measure of people’s character. She goes on to discuss their differing estimations
            of
            a “Mrs. Pugh” and “Mr. and Mrs. Turner,” concluding that “Every person must stand
            or
            fall upon their character as evidenced by their presences.”</p>
         	            
         <h3 id="">1868: "How I wish I could comfort Mary"</h3>
         
         <p>In December 1868, when she wrote the final letter in this collection, Sophia was
            living in Dresden, Germany, where she hoped to find an affordable place to live—her
            financial situation continued to be unstable in large part because of ongoing
            disputes with Hawthorne’s publishers, Ticknor and Fields (Stewart, “Mrs. Hawthorne’s
            Financial Difficulties”). In addition, she hoped that Julian could continue his
            education at the technical university in Dresden. Elizabeth and Mary had published
            <cite>Moral Culture of Infancy and Kindergarten Guide</cite> (1863), which became a fundamental
            text in early childhood education, and her kindergarten, book royalties, and lecture
            fees enabled Peabody in 1867 to visit kindergartens in Germany run by Froebel’s
            former students [is this a direct quote?] (ANB). Based on her travels in Germany,
            she recommended Dresden to Sophia as an affordable place to live. Mary had published
            Life of Horace Mann in 1865, followed by five articles in a series written by
            “celebrated women” published in the 1868–69 issues of the <cite>Herald of Health and
               Journal of Physical Culture</cite>. Signing herself “Mrs. Horace Mann,” she wrote on child
            care, kindergarten, and women’s suffrage [direct quote from ANB?]. </p>
         
         <p>Mary’s oldest son, Horace Mann, Jr. died at 24 of tuberculosis on November 11,
            1868, and Elizabeth’s letter to Sophia of November 12 informing her of his death
            arrived in Dresden on December 3. Sophia’s response, presented here, expresses both
            her grief and her admiration for her nephew, who was a student of Louis Agassiz and
            Asa Gray at Lawrence Scientific School (later part of Harvard University) and
            published "Enumeration of Hawaiian Plants," in the <cite>Proceedings of the American
               Academy of Arts and Sciences</cite> at the age of 22 (“Horace Mann, Jr. Manuscripts").
            Sophia also suggests that she long suspected Horace’s “constitution” would not allow
            him to live a long life: “I never believed that Horace would live to the prime of
            manhood in this world. I was sure he would die young, and so I am not surprised,
            however much I grieve. He had not robustness of constitution enough to bear such
            [constant?] and profound study.” Sophia’s reaction reflects the familiarity of
            mid-nineteenth-century Americans with death at an early age, especially from
            infectious diseases unchecked by modern treatments. The Peabody sisters had already
            lost two brothers in their 20s to disease and now were grieving for a son and
            nephew.</p>
         
         <p>Near the end of the letter, Sophia reluctantly—“I do not incline to write or think
            of any thing but Horace and Mary”—mentions earlier letters to Elizabeth regarding
            her ongoing attempts to settle financial disagreements with Ticknor and Fields, a
            dispute in which Elizabeth interceded on Sophia’s behalf (Stewart, “Mrs. Hawthorne’s
            Quarrel with James T. Fields”). After Nathaniel Hawthorne’s death, Sophia set to

               the American Note-Books of Nathaniel Hawthorne</cite> (1868), published by Ticknor and

            <cite>Passages From the English Note-Books of Nathaniel Hawthorne</cite> (1870), bringing to the
            public the fruits of Sophia Hawthorne’s lifelong practice of travel writing,
            typically recorded in her journals and letters. After reading her journal-letters
            sent home from Cuba, Nathaniel Hawthorne told Sophia she was “the Queen of
            Journalizers” (Marshall, The Peabody Sisters 362), and later in life told James
            Fields that “Mrs. Hawthorne altogether excels me as a writer of travel” (Valenti,
            “Sophia Peabody Hawthorne and ‘The—What?’” 59). Patricia Valenti argues that
            preparing the volumes of her husband’s journals “was not a mechanical activity but
            one that required Sophia to identify and extract from his writing, as she had from
            the paintings she copied as a young woman, the 'aura,' the 'sap,' or in her words,
            'the—what?'” (62), thus combining her two lifelong artistic pursuits.</p>

         <p>"My Dear Elizabeth: Letters from Sophia Peabody Hawthorne to Elizabeth Palmer Peabody,
            1837-1868" is an electronic edition of five letters written by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne
            (1809-1871) to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody (1804-1894). The edition belongs
            to a
            series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of previously unpublished
            nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library
            (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions include "Selected Entries
            from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries, 30 July 1862 to 31 December 1862"; "Selected
            Letters from the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of 
            Stephens Family Travel Letters and Ephemera"; "William B. Anderson's Civil War Correspondence,
            1862-1864"; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by Samuel
            Sullivan Cox; and Louisa A. Doane's "Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853)."</p>
         
         
         <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
            on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
            English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
            opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
            cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
            databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
            what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
            represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
            reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
            students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell
            us
            about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
         
         
         <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
            explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
            the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
            and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
            that shape particular interpretations and presentations of texts; and the mediation
            of
            electronic delivery systems.</p>
         
         
         <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
            need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing
            or
            the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
            the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
            Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
            broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
            example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
            historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
            case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
            need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
            archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
            matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
            the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
            original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
            the source texts. In the case of the Hawthorne letters, we have edited all five of
            Sophia Hawthorne's letters in the RBMS collection.</p>
         
         
         <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
            representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access
            to
            manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with
            a
            variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>
         
         
         <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
            the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
            consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
            structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
            repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
            However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
            revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.</p>

         <h2>Editorial Method</h2>
         <hr>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF images
            at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
            quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was
            used at any stage of image
            preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
            produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur
            in
            Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
            provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.. 
            </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Transcription</strong>. Editing of the Hawthorne letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription: 
            abbreviations, recoverable cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underlining, additions
            above and below
            the line or in the margins, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
            have all been transcribed and encoded, to the best of the editors' ability, as they
            appear in the original manuscripts
            (punctuation and capitalization often can be especially difficult to disambiguate).
            The
            representation of those features varies depending on the view of the letter. An explanation
            of 
            the presentation in each view of the letters can be read via the "About this View"
            link
            at the top of each view's page.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Markup and Annotation</strong>. XML encoding of the Hawthorne letters follows The
            Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <cite>P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</cite>,
            as customized for the project using the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process.
            This editorial introduction and the three "views" of the letters were generated from
            the main XML file
            using XSL transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were
            encoded in HTML separately.
            A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the "Appendices" menu,
            and all source files
            (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and downloaded via the "Source Files" menu.</p>
         
         
         <p>Introductory material (such as this editorial introduction) as well as annotated lists
            of people, places, 
            and organizations mentioned in the letters are encoded in the TEI header of the main
            XML
            document. Other explanatory annotations are linked directly from the text. Separate
            appendices provide 
            further information about the project (e.g., acknowledgements, editors' bios, and
            so on). 
            All these ancillary materials can be viewed via the menus at the top of each page.</p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Proofing</strong>. Students who created the original transcriptions proofread their own
            transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by NINES and preservation
            in The Ohio State University's 
            Knowledge Bank, the transcriptions and encoding were once again proofread by Professor
            Ulman.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Peer Review</strong>. Anonymous reviewers for NINES provided peer-reviews for the editions, in response
            to 
            which they were revised and then reviewed by NINES editors before being listed in
            the NINES database.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Production and Archival Location of Digital Assets</strong>.
            All of the files associated with this edition are accessed via, and archived in, The
            Ohio State University's
            institutional repository, the Knowledge Bank.

            </p>
         <p><strong>Allbutt, Mrs</strong>.
            Unidentified.

            death in 1861. They were in Rome
            during the winter of 1859–1860 hoping to improve Elizabeth's health, as reflected
            in Sophia Hawthorne's report that
            "Mrs Browning does not make visits" (CEN 16:520; DNB).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Browning, Robert</strong> (b. 1812-05-07; d. 1889-12-12).
            Poet, husband of poet Elizabeth Barret Browning. The 
            Brownings lived in Italy on and off throughout their marriage, from 1846 until Elizabeth's
            death in 1861. They were in Rome
            during the winter of 1859–1860 hoping to improve Elizabeth's health, as reflected
            in Sophia Hawthorne's report that
            "Mrs Browning does not make visits" (CEN 15:87; DNB).
            </p>

            Sophia's reference to Nathaniel as "a perfect Diogenes or a god — about going 
            without things" probably refers to a story about Diogenes living in a tub when he
            was unable to procure

            to take tea with Anna Smith at Mary's"
             (Woodson et al. 307, 308).

            Unidentified. Presumably, "the unhappy Weis[s]" to who Sophia Hawthorne refers is

            </p>
         <p><strong>Westons</strong>.
            Presumably, Sophia refers a family of five sisters, one of whom, Lucia, 
            lived as an invalid in Rome from 1853 until her death and was attended by one or more
            of her sisters. 
            Lucia lived at Palazzo Galitzín, located in the center of Rome, just off the Tiber
            in Via della Scrofia #117 ("3994. Harriet Beecher Stowe to EBB," note 3).

            United States (Lat/Long: 
            37.0000 -119.0000). 
            In her letter written in the fall of 1863, Hawthorne writes, "I dreaded Ann's [Ann
            O'Gara] going to California— away 
            from me." California was admitted to the Union in 1850, one year after the storied
            Gold Rush of 1849, which
            resulted in a wave of emigration to the state.</p>
         <p><strong>Concord</strong>.
            United States; Massachusetts (Lat/Long: 
            42.4500 -71.3333). 
            Nathaniel and Sophia Hawthorne lived in Concord, Massachusetts during three periods
            of their lives: as newlyweds, from 1842–1845;
            briefly in 1852–1853; and finally from 1860 after returning from an extended residence
            in Europe (McFarland).</p>
         <p><strong>Dresden</strong>.
            Germany (Lat/Long: 
            51.0500 13.7500). 
            Sophia Hawthorne arrived in Dresden on November 5, 1868, just one month before penning
            the letter included in this collection. Upon her sister Elizabeth's recommendation—Elizabeth
            had been
            studying German kindergartens—Sophia was hoping to find an affordable place to live
            with 
            her children following Nathaniel Hawthorne's death in 1864, and an opportunity for
            her son
            Julian to pursue an engineering degree (Valenti 259–263).</p>
         <p><strong>Palazzo Galitzin</strong>.
            Italy (Lat/Long:

         <p><strong>Rome</strong>.
            Italy (Lat/Long: 
            41.9000 12.4833). 
            The Hawthornes lived in Rome from January 1858 through May 1859. Sophia Hawthorne
            especially valued the large community 
            of expatriate artists she interacted with regularly during
            the family's stay in Rome (Alba 13–14; Valenti 153–155).</p>
         <p><strong>Sandwich Islands</strong>.
            United States (Lat/Long: 
            -23.5000 -165.0000). 
            The name given by James Cook in 1778 to the Hawaiian Islands. In her letter

            to Elizabeth Peabody
            care of Rev. Theodore Parker, West Roxbury.</p>
