         <p>"My Dear Elizabeth: Letters from Sophia Peabody Hawthorne to Elizabeth Palmer Peabody,
            1837-1868" is an electronic edition of five letters written by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne
            (1809-1871) to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody (1804-1894). The edition belongs
            to a
            series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of previously unpublished
            nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library
            (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions include "Selected Entries
            from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries, 30 July 1862 to 31 December 1862"; "Selected
            Letters from the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of 
            Stephens Family Travel Letters and Ephemera"; "William B. Anderson's Civil War Correspondence,
            1862-1864"; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by Samuel
            Sullivan Cox; and Louisa A. Doane's "Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853)."</p>
         
         
         <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
            on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
            English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
            opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
            cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
            databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
            what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
            represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
            reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
            students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell
            us
            about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
         
         
         <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
            explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
            the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
            and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
            that shape particular interpretations and presentations of texts; and the mediation
            of
            electronic delivery systems.</p>
         
         
         <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
            need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing
            or
            the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
            the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
            Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
            broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
            example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
            historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
            case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
            need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
            archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
            matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
            the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
            original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
            the source texts. In the case of the Hawthorne letters, we have edited all five of
            Sophia Hawthorne's letters in the RBMS collection.</p>
         
         
         <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
            representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access
            to
            manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with
            a
            variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>
         
         
         <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
            the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
            consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
            structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
            repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
            However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
            revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.</p>

         <h2>Editorial Method</h2>
         <hr>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF images
            at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
            quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was
            used at any stage of image
            preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
            produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur
            in
            Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
            provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.. 
            </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Transcription</strong>. Editing of the Hawthorne letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription: 
            abbreviations, recoverable cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underlining, additions
            above and below
            the line or in the margins, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
            have all been transcribed and encoded, to the best of the editors' ability, as they
            appear in the original manuscripts
            (punctuation and capitalization often can be especially difficult to disambiguate).
            The
            representation of those features varies depending on the view of the letter. An explanation
            of 
            the presentation in each view of the letters can be read via the "About this View"
            link
            at the top of each view's page.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Markup and Annotation</strong>. XML encoding of the Hawthorne letters follows The
            Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <cite>P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</cite>,
            as customized for the project using the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process.
            This editorial introduction and the three "views" of the letters were generated from
            the main XML file
            using XSL transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were
            encoded in HTML separately.
            A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the "Appendices" menu,
            and all source files
            (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and downloaded via the "Source Files" menu.</p>
         
         
         <p>Introductory material (such as this editorial introduction) as well as annotated lists
            of people, places, 
            and organizations mentioned in the letters are encoded in the TEI header of the main
            XML
            document. Other explanatory annotations are linked directly from the text. Separate
            appendices provide 
            further information about the project (e.g., acknowledgements, editors' bios, and
            so on). 
            All these ancillary materials can be viewed via the menus at the top of each page.</p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Proofing</strong>. Students who created the original transcriptions proofread their own
            transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by NINES and preservation
            in The Ohio State University's 
            Knowledge Bank, the transcriptions and encoding were once again proofread by Professor
            Ulman.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Peer Review</strong>. Anonymous reviewers for NINES provided peer-reviews for the editions, in response
            to 
            which they were revised and then reviewed by NINES editors before being listed in
            the NINES database.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Production and Archival Location of Digital Assets</strong>.
            All of the files associated with this edition are accessed via, and archived in, The
            Ohio State University's
            institutional repository, the Knowledge Bank.

            Brownings lived in Italy on and off throughout their marriage, from 1846 until Elizabeth's
            death in 1861. They were in Rome
            during the winter of 1859–1860 hoping to improve Elizabeth's health, as reflected
            in Sophia Hawthorne's report that
            "Mrs Browning does not make visits" (CEN 16:520; DNB).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Browning, Robert</strong> (b. 1812-05-07; d. 1889-12-12).
            Poet, husband of poet Elizabeth Barret Browning. The 
            Brownings lived in Italy on and off throughout their marriage, from 1846 until Elizabeth's
            death in 1861. They were in Rome
            during the winter of 1859–1860 hoping to improve Elizabeth's health, as reflected
            in Sophia Hawthorne's report that
            "Mrs Browning does not make visits" (CEN 15:87; DNB).

            </p>
         <p><strong>Diogenes of Sinope</strong> (b. c. 404 BCE; d. 323 BCE).
            Sophia's reference to Nathaniel as "a perfect Diogenes or a god — about going 
            without things" probably refers to a story about Diogenes living in a tub when he
            was unable to procure
            housing in Athens (Piering).

         <p><strong>California</strong>.
            United States (Lat/Long: 
            37.0000 -119.0000). 
            In her letter written in the fall of 1863, Hawthorne writes, "I dreaded Ann's [Ann
            O'Gara] going to California— away 
            from me." California was admitted to the Union in 1850, one year after the storied
            Gold Rush of 1849, which
            resulted in a wave of emigration to the state.</p>
         <p><strong>Concord</strong>.
            United States; Massachusetts (Lat/Long: 
            42.4500 -71.3333). 
            Nathaniel and Sophia Hawthorne lived in Concord, Massachusetts during three periods
            of their lives: as newlyweds, from 1842–1845;
            briefly in 1852–1853; and finally from 1860 after returning from an extended residence
            in Europe (McFarland).</p>
         <p><strong>Dresden</strong>.
            Germany (Lat/Long: 
            51.0500 13.7500). 
            Sophia Hawthorne arrived in Dresden on November 5, 1868, just one month before penning
            the letter included in this collection. Upon her sister Elizabeth's recommendation—Elizabeth
            had been
            studying German kindergartens—Sophia was hoping to find an affordable place to live
            with 
            her children following Nathaniel Hawthorne's death in 1864, and an opportunity for
            her son
            Julian to pursue an engineering degree (Valenti 259–263).</p>
         <p><strong>Palazzo Galitzin</strong>.

            of Weston sisters.</p>
         <p><strong>Rock Ferry</strong>.
            England (Lat/Long:

            Liverpool (Valenti 100–101).</p>
         <p><strong>Rome</strong>.
            Italy (Lat/Long: 
            41.9000 12.4833). 
            The Hawthornes lived in Rome from January 1858 through May 1859. Sophia Hawthorne
            especially valued the large community 
            of expatriate artists she interacted with regularly during
            the family's stay in Rome (Alba 13–14; Valenti 153–155).</p>
         <p><strong>Sandwich Islands</strong>.
            United States (Lat/Long: 
            -23.5000 -165.0000). 
            The name given by James Cook in 1778 to the Hawaiian Islands. In her letter
            of 4 December 1868, Hawthorne refers to Horace Mann, Jr.'s biological research trip

            to Elizabeth Peabody
            care of Rev. Theodore Parker, West Roxbury.</p>
