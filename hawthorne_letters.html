            In this letter, Sophia Peabody attempts to correct misunderstandings between herself
            and her sister 
            Elizabeth regarding Sophia's estimation of Abigail May Alcott [Mrs. Bronson Alcott]
            and, more generally, 
            the sisters' differing attitudes toward "fault-finding." Before mailing the letter
            to Elizabeth, Sophia gives it 
            to her sister Mary, who adds her own perspective on the misunderstanding, asking for
            sympathy 
            and peace as well as communicating her frustrations with both of her sisters.

            <br>8th August
            <br>My DearElizabeth,
            
            
            <p>
                I have just read your long letter. 
                I cannot wait a moment before disabusing you 
                of one entire mistake, which is your
               impression of my estimation of Mrs. Alcott. You never
                heard me express for her a want of respect 
                or love, for from the beginning &amp; through all 
                I have thought her a sort of sublime phenomenon — a terrible power made up of 
               divinest tenderness— vast humanity — infinite
                self sacrifice — a perfect juggernaut devotion 
                to the Right. I have loved her dearly always.
                How can you think otherwise. [sic]  Don't you remember 
                at that time my sympathy with her — &amp; afterwards 
                my writing often to her, &amp; ever since the affectionate 
                way in which we have ever met. [sic]  I have always 
                felt the utmost tenderness for her. I scarcely 
                ever saw a person who seemed to me so full 
                of pathos — amounting to the fearful. I am at a
                loss to imagine how you have such an idea in 
                your mind. Does it not show what complete,
                misunderstandings may exist — I never thought her deformed,  never moved by earthly passion.
               
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a long talk with Mary the other 
                evening about this discussing of people's faults. 
                She said she never before understood what
                I meant, &amp; she did not believe you did.
                It is not that I do not see people do wrong — &amp; that 
                therefore I necessarily am unjust — but I have 
                understood Christ to teach that if each one looked 
                only to his own errors, perhaps there would be juster [sic] 
                judgment &amp; greater improvement in individuals. 
                When he speaks plainly I prefer to understand 
                him plainly, for I find it the most fruitful 
                of good. It has not been a personal feeling 
                for particular persons — for Mr. Alcott for instance, 
                but this general principle, which would make
                me feel the same if a person I never knew
               
               
               
               
                were analysed [sic]  &amp; decided upon. I know 
                that GOD only can know a person truly, 
                from my own experience, &amp; I know that immense 
                mistakes are made in sweeping or even in what
                seem cool, rational judgments of others. 
                But as the seeing mind cannot but observe 
                I have thought that each person had better 
                not by talking
                emphasize bad opinions of men —[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]  arguing 
                pronouncing &amp; deciding upon their motives &amp; actions, 
                which ever must be somewhat in the dark —
                but let the opinion be constantly modified
                or changed in the mind by the evolving of circumstances &amp; 
                the influx of more light. Then no one would 
                be so cruelly wronged as some are — &amp; there 
                would be more time &amp; room for the interchange 
                of thought about things which are eternal —
                Christ might say <q>Woe unto you, hypocrites!</q> Because 
                there was no mote in his eye to take out,<a name="pmote" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nmote" class="annotation" title="See Matt. 7: 3-5."><sup>1</sup></a> &amp; he 
                could see with clear vision, what was in 
                man, but it is not so with the less exalted. 
                I have said to myself Oh let me enjoy &amp; speak 
                of the good I see —
                &amp; be silent of the evil I see. 
               You &amp; Mary have thought me morbid about 
                hearing certain people spoken of — I always knew
                this was not the truth. It was not the person 
                but the thing that I struggled against. 
                Even when I have mutely listened, I have 
                always had a mental reservation that perhaps 
                it was not so — for GOD alone could see the heart —
                &amp; comprehend all the grounds upon which it 
                acted. I can see good in being openeyed
               &amp; not acting with a rash confidence — but I
                suspect I shall live forever &amp; not see good
               
               
               
               
               in dwelling upon personal faults. For my life
               I cannot
               percieve [sic]  the least use in talking
               about them. I never hear of a great crime
               committed that I do not wish I had a hundred
               thousand arms &amp; powers to guard the person
               from being utterly condemned, because no man
               can know the tragedy, the struggle, the woe,
               the misery of the being's inward life who
               transgressed—and it is an infinite comfort to me
               always to know that GOD knows all &amp; will accordingly
               award with infinite tenderness— &amp; allow for 
               want of light. A murder which horrifies the
               community never seems to me so dreadful or wrong
               in the eye of Heaven as the animadversions of
               those who think they are more righteous than the
               murderer. Nevertheless, I can  certainly suppose
               that to you it may seem quite otherwise about
               this matter, &amp; that you do your duty in a way
               of proceeding, which with my idea—it would
               manifestly be wrong for me to adopt.
               I never thought it want of charity in you
               or Mary
               to
               
               percieve [sic] 
                failings—but that it did
               more harm than good to talk about them—
               because I know it is impossible for an intelligent
               mind not to take observations. But to[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] 
               it has been productive of more good to [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] 
                reflect as little as possible upon the shadow
               
               
                &amp; live &amp; expand in the
               light &amp;  I feel
               more love &amp; charity &amp; see more every day.
               GOD will give the increase to both our sowings
               
               since both
               are 
               sown in obedience
               to the conscience. I never considered myself
               better than you or Mary
               or whoever — but in
               some things I am very different in my habits
               of mind. I never compare myself wi[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] th others — I
               try to be as simply
               as possible without[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]  thinking
               how I am— &amp; I never feel how I am except when I
               
               
               
               
               fall short as I often do of the mark. I am conscious
               of it &amp; feel remorse. It is only in remorse that 
               I feel myself — when I am unjust to others — or 
               impatient — then I am smitten as with a rod — &amp; 
               feel how much better others are then I — but the 
               contrary never occupies my thoughts. 
               If I have verged to either extreme it has been that
               every body was better then I, <em>ceteris paribus.</em>
               Do not suppose I extend this fault finding face 
               to face. I think this is good &amp; productive of great benefit 
               — for then the two persons being all that 
               are concerned in the matter can take care of
               themselves, &amp; be improved by each other's lights. 
                But to talk &amp; judge of a person 
               who is not present to have his or her dictum
               may cause great harm &amp; wrong. But do not
               
               
               
               
               
               ever take for granted by inference a harsh judgment. Now both
               you &amp; Mary have taken up this idea of my view of Mrs. Alcott
               because I had said she was violent &amp; said tremendous things to
               her husband. But you should have stopped at my words — &amp; then you
               would
               have been 
               more just —
               I never
               said I 
               did not 
               respect 
               &amp; love her —
               nor implied 
               it intentionally — I 
               think we 
               always 
               come 
               nearest 
               right when 
               we infer 
               the best 
               instead 
               of the 
               worst 
               thing —
               I wish 
               you would 
               not think 
               you know 
               what I 
               never express.
               As to 
               Beauty 
               I would
               
               
               
               
               never sacrifice one iota of goodness or truth to it as you might suppose —
               but Christ was even beautiful — &amp; my aim is to do so, as well as true &amp;
               good — for I think Beauty is the result of the two. But I never was
               
               
               
               
                aware of seeking beauty in the first place. By keeping my heart
                right, which [sic]  is goodness, I hope to see truth, &amp; then Beauty
                will flow. This is my order — not the contrary. I have scarcely
                taken the first step; but I feel that this is
                the way to go. 
               You say it is not my tas[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]  think of Mr. Alcott's
               failings — this I did not say
               but it is my taste [ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ] 
                talk of any body 's failings. Don't you see why I do not
               like to say anything. You misunderstand me
               
               
               
               
                almost always — or give it with 
                your mind a little different
               aspect. That saying ^
               you repeat about the imagination
                is ^not  just as I meant it
                but no matter. I hate
               to explain.

               <br> she has said to you here) I told 
               <br>her I felt as if all was settled
               <br> now, &amp; I think she does
               <br> but I did not persist in
               <br> talking, for she said she felt
               <br> as if her body was just where 
               <br> it was seven months ago tho'
               <br> her mind was in a different
               <br> state. Now don't tell her I 
               <br> told you this about her body, for*
               
               
               
               
               <br> *if you wish to have her tranquil, you must let her alone 
               <br> more. I believe if you &amp; she have any more cryings 
               <br> about each other I shall die. I have often wished you
               
               
               
               
               <br> both dead, &amp; I shall never enjoy you
               <br> till I think this matter is not to be
               <br> alluded to again. I hope you will not
               <br> say Alcott for one year if you can help
               <br> it, for the word is the touchstone to
               <br> all this emotion. There is no temper
               <br> in her crying now if there ever was—it
               <br> is pure physical agony — but she only apprehends now
               <br> that it will be perhaps difficult to appear
               <br> natural, at least for a time &amp; that you
               <br> will misconstrue that. I have assured
               <br> her that you will allow for that, and now
               <br> the rest must be left to you. My happiness waits upon 
               <br> your good judgment. yr M.
               <br> I'm going to send for Harriet &amp; Mrs

            <br>Tuesday 1/2 4. Nov 19th 
            1839
            <br>My dearLizzie,
            
            
            <p>
               I suppose that Mr. Taylor
               
               2
                has
               told you of George's 
               3
                perfect frame
               of mind — of his experience of
               that divine glow which was so
               unaccountable — but so sweet &amp;
               refreshing to him — &amp; seemed so like
               an intimation from GOD that
               it was well with him —; but he
               would not tell you how like
               a tender &amp; strong angel he  ^
                himself  was
               to us all — what a wonderful
               prayer he offered — which seemed
               to bring the host of heaven
               down to watch &amp; duly ward -
               which brought heaven into
               George's chamber &amp; carried us
               all as on Dove's wings into
               the spiritual world.  It was the
               most fervid — the most affectionate,
               tender &amp; divine uplifting of 
               soul to the infinite father —
               that I ever heard.  He prayed for 
               each — for the <q>Mother, 
                  4
                   the tender
                  Mother — who hung around her life</q>
               for the Father's 
               5
                manly heart —
               for the sister 
               6
                whose duty called
               her away — <q> &amp; oh bless — our dear Mary
                  
                  7
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  he said — let not that peaceful
                  stream be disturbed — </q> " he prayed
               for the sister present
               8
                 — 'she with
               the delicate nerves —' For Aunt
               Pickman
               
               9
                too he petitioned
               heaven —     The tears were at
               last loosened from my brain
               which I had kept back so long
               that I began to feel as if they
               were accumulating there —
               &amp; they flowed down my face
               like a summer rain without
               convulsion.  After he rose
               from his knees, George stretched 
               out his arms &amp; Mr. Taylor
               clasped him to his heart in
               a long, long embrace — Every
               moment ejaculating "The Lord
               bless you!  Bless you!  Bless you!"
               in such a thrilling tone that
               it seemed as if blessings must
               come in legions at the call —
               
               George's thin white hands were
               
               
               
               
               so firmly fastened round his neck
               that I thought he would never
               let the angel go — even after he
               had blessed him — but at last
               he relaxed his hold. Then  Mr
               Taylor turned to me &amp; took both
               hands. <q>Be strong</q> said he. <q>
                  It is
                  very pleasant on the other side. Be
                  quiet like a May morning.</q>
               He came with me into my room.
               
               <q>Oh George is a perfect lamb! A
                  perfect lamb. He is moonlight —
                  so clear — mild — I would not but
                  have seen him for the world. It
                  was worth coming just to look at
                  him. He never looked so handsome
                  in his life. There is no distortion
                  there. All is right. All is right.</q>
               I cannot tell you all he said now.
               Oh he is the most helpful — the
               divinest spirit — is he not?
               
               George said there could not be such
               a prayer conceived of. <q>
                  Mr. Taylor
                  is no sham</q> — he said.
               
               George is very much revived this
               afternoon. He had not a bad
               chill this morning — hardly any — &amp;
               yesterday it was
               two hours long 
               
               
               
               
               
               Mary came today &amp; staid two hours
               I carried her your letter this afternoon
               &amp; she had recieved [sic]  no harm.
               
               George thinks it would not be
               right for you to come on
               Wednesday. He thinks of
               every thing in all relations
               with exactest precision.
               Yesterday he wandered a
               little several times, &amp; this
               afternoon while I was rubbing
               his arm, he was saying
               something — &amp; then said something
               I did not hear. <q>What did
                  you say</q> I asked. <q>It  [
                  
                  ?] 
                  was nothing to the purpose, he
                  replied. I was wandering.</q>
               I never saw such clearness. He
               looks from some high place
               even upon his aberrations.
               I can write no more now
               I recieved [sic]  a blessed refreshment
               yesterday P.M. beside  Mr
               Taylor, a long — closely written letter

            <br>Mrs H
            <br>My Dear Elizabeth
            
            
            <p>
               I am really
               too tired to write a letter,
               but cannot bear to let a
               chance slip. Una has
               
               written a sad letter which
               I fear will make your
               heart ache. I am glad
               to say that the Roman
               fever seems to have been
               arrested in her —; for she
               has had no chills for two
               days. She is a lily now,
               her lifelong roses snatched
               away, but during these
               two days I have thought
               to see a dawn of roses
               in her cheeks and lips,
               though she is now suffering
               from influenza.

            <p>
               
               Ada's fever is past. She
               is well of that today, but has
               a very painful shoulder —;
               and lies in bed still.
               
               
               
               
                I have had no moment to 
                write to you in all these 
                weeks —; having been ill 
                myself in the interval 
                of nursing others.  No Rome 
                this winter for us so far. 
                My journal is left in the 
                middle of a sentence, which 
                can never be recalled 
                now,  and I am 
                sorry, because I had an 
                idea of the  [Faun?]  at that moment.

                Perhaps we shall have 
                February and March 
                for a little enjoyment 
                of Rome, and half of April. 
                Then we leave it for aye 
                and go to Venice and thence 
                to the cities in the north 
                of Italy &amp; to Geneva and 
                Paris.

               Mrs. Ward is here and I 
                have not had a moment 
                to go and see her.  But I had 
                a long note from her. She
               
               
               
               
                is very happy and content in her 
                sunny sky-parlor in the Hotel 
                d'Angliterre — <q>with no cares, no 
                   anxieties, only hopes</q> she says. 
                She suffered terribly from the 
                severe treatment of Dr Simpson
                but expects to feel benefit 
                next summer from it. 
                Neither have I been able to see 
                once Mrs Browning, and 
                only once Mr Browning who 
                has been three times to see 
                us.  Mrs Browning does not 
                make visits. Mary Motley
                I see here sometimes.  I 
                have read the Dutch Republic<a name="pdutch" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#ndutch" class="annotation" title="Note about The Dutch Republic.."><sup>2</sup></a>
                during my watches, and the 
                book is superb, I think. 
                Miss Cushman has been here, 
                but I could not see her. 
                Mr. Hawthorne saw her. 
                No society for me this winter. 
                Rosebud is exquisitely good 
                generous and considerate in 
                these times, but I can give 
                you no Altar of Roses now. 
                Mr. Hawthorne is quite 
                well.  Here is cause for 
                great joy — for last winter he 
               
               
               
               
                had the Grippe three months. 
                Julian also is well with 
                only slight nose cold. 
                Rose has today gone to 
                the Palazzo Galitzin<a name="pgalitzin" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#ngalitzin" class="annotation" title="A fashionable district in the 19th century located in the center of Rome, just off the Tiber in Via della Scrofia #117 ROM 208-209."><sup>3</sup></a> to see 
               the Westons, who delight in 
                her.  She draws with a 
                wonderful expression. 
                Julian copies Flaxman
                <em>a merveille</em>.

                I long to answer all 
                your letters one by one — 
                and I long to tell you much. 
                I have sent some letters 
                of Una to you and Mary 
                lately.  I never got

                directed to Florence.  Though 
                Mr. Browning has written 
                about them to the Post Office 
                they do not come.  I have 
                lost all your account of dear 
                Dr. Wesselhoeft. I endure 
                astonishingly through all

            <br>Sunday
            <br>My Dear Elizabeth, I have
            
            
            <p>
                become so occupied with 
                the unhappy Weiss, that 
                with my necessary household 
                cares, mending &amp; making —
                I have not had one 
                moment to answer your 
                note. It is Sunday and 
                all the children are at 
                Church, and I have a 
                few moments of my own —
                and out of a hundred 
                things I want to do, I 
                take some time for you. 
                We could not take 
                advantage of the free
                lessons of Dr. Kinner
                for Una, on account
                partly of the expense 
                of railroad fare — while 
                there were other reasons 
               less imperative. I am very sorry, but *
               
               
               
               
                since there is not 
                literally money enough 
                for it — I accept the 
                disappointment. For it 
                is certainly a very plain 
                duty not to spend other
                peoples' money for 
                accomplishments — ^or any thing else. And as 
                we are very closely pressed 
                this year — and feel it 
                important not to grind 
                Julian too closely in
                college, (though he must 
                be exceedingly economical 
                at the best) — we must 
                all sacrifice a great 
                many pleasant things. 
                If Mr Hawthorne did 
                not write, we could by 
                no means make our 
                expenses come within 
                our income, and 
                it is a pain to him
                to be so hard driven 
               
               
               
               
                in his present unenergetic 
                condition, and he 
                doubts if we can at any rate
                easily make the ends 
                meet. The Smiths have
                sent for Una and Julian
                to go to see them this 
                winter. But for the 
                same reason, they cannot 
                go. It would cost at 
                least thirty dollars for 
                travel from our door to theirs, and 
                Julian would have to 
                have a new suit of 
                clothes — costing thirty
               more — before he could
               go. As to me, I am 
                going without any 
                thing new whatever 
                and I only wish I could 
                give up any thing more	
                so as to gratify
                them. As to their father
               
               
               
               
                he is a perfect Diogenes
                or a god — about going 
                without things. He will 
                not allow himself the 
                smallest expenditure. 
               Julian has had expensive 
                books stolen by some 
                theives [sic]  among the 
                Sophomores — one very 
               immense Greek Lexicon, 
                what I should think 
                must have cost five 
                dollars at least. 
                Professor Gurney says <q>this 
                   is one of the dirtiest 
                   of their dirty tricks</q> and 
                that there is no redress. 
                 Julian gets along 
                splendidly as a brave 
                and gentle Dear Sir and stalwart 
                knight. A gentleman 
                told me he was looked 
                upon as a powerful 
                lion — and one of his 
                names is <q>the Immortal 
                   Hawthorne.</q> He makes no
               
               
               
               
               2<sup>d</sup>
                aggression, but  
               defends the weak              
                and no one dares to
                touch him — as they 
                all know him strong —
                and find him valiant.
                He has not a particle 
                of low, unchristian vindic 
                tiveness in his nature —
                They make broad 
                lanes for him to pass
                when they think he
                might revenge some
                classmate's wrong — 
                and treat him personally
                with high respect and
                the good, gentlemanly 
                Sophomores are his
                friends. But if I tell
                you so much, you will
                say I am making a 
                fine story and praising
                him too much. It is a 
                pity I cannot talk to
                a sister without that
                suspicion — is n't [sic]  it?
               
               
               
               
                When I do not answer 
                your notes, dear Elizabeth 
                sometimes, it is not
                because I accept
                them, but because I
                disagree, and think it
                of no use to discuss
                the matter. Some things
                in that long ago note
                I agreed with, however —
                Rose's face expresses too
                much critical displeasure
                I very well see often.
                She is in precisely the
                mood that Una was
                in at her age in Rock
                Ferry. Una was then
                disgusted with every body 
                and thing that did not 
                suit her taste &amp; principles
                and seemed to fail
                utterly in St Paul's 
                Charity. I was quite
               
               
               
               
                alarmed, until a certain 
                Mrs. Allbut told me
                that I need not fear
                at all, for that when
                Una was eighteen she
                would be all right, and
                that this fastidiousness
                at her age was the
                most hopeful of all
                states. I find it true.
                Una is always excusing
                every body now, and 
                finding good points
                in every one, and no
                soul is more full of
                generous, self sacrificing
                love. Every person I
                know in Concord
                bursts out to me about
                her in enthusiastic
                praise — not moderate 
                but enthusiastic praise.
                You get all your evil
                impressons [sic]  of her
               
               
               
               
                from the Alcotts probably,
                as no one else maligns 
                her. Mrs Emerson, all
                the Emersons, the 
                Pritchards, the MacKays,
                the Hoars, the all
                the world of Concord
                agree in love to her.
                They call her <q>loveliest</q>
                <q>the most devoted</q> <q>the
                   most generous</q> and
                all sorts of pretty names.
                Miss Rose deserves your
                censure, but as she
                has a world of adoring
                love in her, I hope she
                will  [soon?] love all 
                her fellow creatures
                as she now loves
                some of them. I
                talk with her a great —
                deal about the propriety 
                of feeling genial and 
                pleased in society —
                and I shall continue to
               
               
               
               
               3<sup>d</sup>
                adjure her. But
                I do not doubt she 
                will be a loving and 
                gracious person. For
                you do not know what 
                a power of generosity 
                she has — and all in
                the true Christ— spirit 
                of not letting the right 
                hand know &amp;c. For 
                this is one thing they
                were born with as 
                I have brought out —
                to make no show of 
                any thing they can 
                do or feel . . . They are 
                genuine &amp; and all 
                as true as heaven itself. 
                Oh dear — now I am 
                off on this eulogistic 
                track. But really if 
                you lived with them 
                you would not love 
                them little. And if 
                you could see how  Julian's
               
               
               
               
                innocence is becoming 
                virtue, you would be 
                glad as I am; and
                overflow sometimes. 
                Religious principle is 
                the only sure guard
                angelic, and I am sure 
                they all have it. They 
                are all reverent. 
                I think a cultivated 
                imagination and a 
                delicate — or unsmothered
                conscience are the diamond 
                shield against evil. 
                Julian's memory scintillates 
                with high, heroic thoughts 
                and deeds. His father 
                put into him, reading 
                aloud, every noble story 
                of literature. He has 
                therefore kept the 
                highest society — and 
                has no love for
               
               
               
               
                low persons — no
                tastes that are ignoble. 
                But I will stop this 
                talk — whether or no. 
                Who told the Queen of 
                the Angels<a name="pangels" class="notePointer"></a><a href="#nangels" class="annotation" title="Presumably Sophia's sister, Mary Tyler Peabody Mann."><sup>4</sup></a> that I 
                complained about the 
                injury of the books? I 
                did not — and I never 
                asked any one to tell 
                her — I never thought it 
                owing to her carelessness —
                for I know she is 
                never careless. But 
                all the fly leaves were 
                torn out up to the
                very commencement 
                of the text in very 
                many. It seemed as 
                if they were torn out 
                for waste paper. 
                Somebody did it — but 
                I never supposed

                She will not be so
                angry therefore with
                me — who sent her no
                reproach nor message
                and would have
                forbidden anyone to
                say a word to her —
                she will not punish
                me, so innocent, by
                never borrowing
                another book from me!
                And she too, the Queen
                of the Angels! Tell
                her then to lay off her
                crown, for she is not
                the <em>Regina angelorum</em>
                any longer. I wish
                folk would leave me

                finding — my own duty, in

                fancy Mrs Pugh is because
                she disenchanted herself
                by her artificialness and
                an effect of unveritable
               ness. At first I went
                upon your impression
                of her, and your talk of
                her to me. But very
                soon she became
                 [oppressive?]  and sultry
                and not genuine to
                me. And I declare I
                cannot help this.
                It is her fault, not
                mine. No reasoning
                no developments of
                her life will help it.
                Every person must stand
                or fall upon their character
                as evidenced by their
                presences.  It is a
                law of the universe
                and no talk will alter it.
               
               
               
                I take a fancy to
                Mr. &amp; Mrs. Turner, of
                whom you speak very
                 [Sneeringly?]  because they
                are single, simple, true,
                lovely and refined —
                These are very good
                reasons, and very good
                qualities.

            <p>
                I am sorry I have
                no drawings for your
                babies this week.
                But I have been
                overwhemed [sic]  since
                the suicide of  Adelaide
                Weis with cares
                for the rest of them —
                I have had to 
                neglect many things —
                not however so imperative
               
               
               
               
               stationer's mark.
               
                as their needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have the comfort of
                a perfect peace and
                order &amp; intelligence
                in the kitchen — for
                which I am most
                thankful — for I
                dreaded Ann's going
                to California— away
                from me. There are
                other treasures, I
                find among the
                 [Irish?]  besides her.
                Indeed I knew this
                but feared not to
                become possessed
                of them.
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I hope you are very
                well and that the
                Queen of the Angels
                is well this autumn.
               
               
               
               
                Give my love to
                her.

         <p><a name="view"></a> In this reading text of the Stephens letters, line breaks in the
            manuscripts are not reported; rather, lines wrap in the browser's window. Similarly,
            page
            breaks are not reported. Paragraph breaks follow those in the manuscript. Spelling,
            punctuation, capitalization, and abbreviations are reported as they appear in the
            manuscript. Text highlighted by the correspondents with an underscore is underscored
            in this
            view. Canceled text is suppressed. Text added between lines or in the margins is silently
            incorporated into the reading text. All material added by the editors is surrounded
            by
            square brackets: uncertain readings are enclosed in square brackets and followed by
            a
            question mark, and text supplied by the editor for clarity is set in italics and surrounded
            by square brackets. Gaps in the manuscript (e.g., from tears) are indicated by elipses
            enclosed by square brackets. Links to notes and external materials are colored.
